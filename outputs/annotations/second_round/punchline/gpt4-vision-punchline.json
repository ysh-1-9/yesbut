On the right side, labeled \"BUT,\" there's a photograph of an actual urban setting with tangled power lines against a backdrop of the sky, which disrupts the idealized image.

The left panel shows a single stylized person with a blue splash on their head, while the right panel shows several individuals in a choir format with various colors splashed on their heads. The joke here appears to be a play on the phrase \"Yes, but...\" which is commonly used to acknowledge a point before bringing up exceptions or objections.

The right side displays a silhouette of a woman choosing to take an elevator instead of the stairs, suggesting a choice for convenience over extra physical effort. The humor in the meme comes from the contrast between the two actions: exercising with purpose versus avoiding a small opportunity for exercise in daily life.

The humor arises from the contradiction presented: while the quote criticizes consumerism, the action of buying the T-shirt with the quote on it suggests participation in the very consumerism being critiqued.

    "20240101_181009_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The punchline in this meme is portrayed through the contrast between two computer login screens.

However, on the right side, the \"sign in\" screen displays the same user unsure of their password, with the \"Forgot password?\" option highlighted, implying that despite having just created a strong password, the user has already forgotten it.

The second panel has the word \"BUT\" and shows a stick figure struggling to carry multiple grocery items without a bag, suggesting the impracticality or inconvenience that can sometimes arise despite the intention to be eco-friendly.

On the right side, the text \"BUT\" with a screenshot shows that, in reality, the available space is less than the advertised capacity (235.35 GB available), which is a common occurrence due to the operating system and pre-installed apps",

It's a simple play on words using visual elements.",

On the right, there's a drawing of a person's hand holding a device pointed at another person's wrist, which appears to read \"NO COVID.\" This is a humorous take on the temperature checks that became very common during the COVID-19 pandemic, where instead of checking for a fever, the device is checking if the person has COVID itself, which is an exaggeration of the actual capabilities of temperature scanners.\n\nThe left side of the meme shows a chaotic street scene with cars, cyclists, and pedestrians in various states of collision and confusion, with an affirmative \"YES,\" implying that while the person may",

On the right under \"BUT,\" there is an illustration of a person lying in bed apparently asleep, with their smartphone on silent mode on the nightstand, suggesting that despite the request, the person forgot to reply because they went straight to bed and silenced their phone.

The right panel includes the word \"BUT\" and illustrates the not-smiling person enjoying a pool with a water slide while other noticeably older individuals in bathing caps are behind him, suggesting they are swimming laps. The humor in this meme derives from the contrast between the individual's apparent social alienation in one setting versus their contentment and nonchalance in an unusual or unexpected context. It plays on the theme of finding joy in unique places where one might not typically belong or be expected",

On the right side, the punchline is revealed with a scene of an overcrowded beach labeled \"Secret Beach\" as well, humorously indicating that the beach is not so secret after all due to the large number of people present. The humor comes from the irony that a place labeled as 'secret' is clearly well-known and popular, negating the idea of it being a secret.",

The \"YES,\" panel shows a person using a stair-stepping machine to exercise, which suggests a deliberate effort to engage in a healthy activity. The \"BUT\" panel humorously juxtaposes this with a person opting to take an elevator instead of the stairs, which is a common everyday decision that contradicts the effort shown in the first panel. This contrast emphasizes the ironies in human behavior where individuals may engage in purposeful exercise but then seek convenience in regular activities that could also provide physical benefits.",

The left panel shows a person happily listening to music on their phone with earbuds, while the right panel depicts a person stuck in a car, also listening to music, but with the added implication of being stuck in traffic or just not as freely enjoying the music due to the situation. The humor likely comes from the relatability of enjoying music but not always being in the ideal situation to do so, such as the difference between listening in a relaxed setting versus while driving.",

This meme plays on the common observation that cats have a quirky affinity for boxes, regardless of the other toys or furniture their owners provide for them.",

The right side shows a close-up drawing of a person's face with a focus on the cheek, humorously implying that when someone is asked to smile for a photo, it might result in an awkward or uncomfortable facial expression, hence the circled area to highlight the strained smile. The humor arises from the juxtaposition of the idealized expectation versus the less-than-ideal reality.",

The second pie chart, also labeled \"Fruits,\" is mostly taken up by one large black segment that indicates a significant majority, with only a tiny fraction left for the other categories.\n\nThe humor in the meme lies in the contrast between the expected equitable distribution in the first chart and the unexpected dominance of one category in",

The second image displays cartoon socks designed to look like feet in sandals with bloodied bandages, giving a comic and contrasting impression of discomfort or injury often associated with wearing high heels for extended periods. This implies that while heels may look nice (\"YES\"), they can also be quite uncomfortable or painful (\"BUT\").

The second half with the word \"BUT,\" shows that same image from the top view making the umbrella appear as a large pan, and the people as ingredients in a cooking pan, suggesting a negative or ominous scenario.

The punchline comes in the second panel, where the character finds out that everyone else at the party is wearing the same costume, which is humorous because it subverts the expectation of wearing a unique or creative costume to a Halloween party.

The right panel contrasts this with a character stepping into a puddle, and their long pants are getting soaked, accompanied by the word \"BUT,\" implying a downside or negative consequence to having such long pants. The humor comes from the literal interpretation of \"but\" sounding like \"butt,\" which is humorously represented by the focus on the person's bottom half.

    "20240101_174213_ORIG_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": "The meme shows a car veering off the road and crashing into a tree with the words \"YES,\" on the left and \"BUT\" on the right, suggesting a scenario where someone might admit to a fact but then immediately counters with a contrasting or contradictory point, humorously illustrated by the car hitting a tree as the metaphorical \"but\" or obstacle.",
    "20240101_175208_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The meme depicts a contrasting scenario using visual puns. On the left side, there's an image representing the word \"YES,\" shown by a card with an ice cream graphic melting downwards, visually resembling a nodding movement, which is often associated with the affirmative response \"yes.\" On the right, the image shows a hand holding an ice cream with a melting scoop, but it's upside-down, resembling a head shaking, which is commonly associated with the word \"BUT\" that is written above. This represents a play on the physical gestures symbolizing \"yes\" and \"but,\" where \"but\" typically signifies a contradiction or exception",
    "20240101_172944_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The meme depicts a juxtaposition of two situations with the punchline \"YES, BUT.\" On the left side, there's an image of excited people around a sign that says \"50% OFF\" with \"SALE\" speech bubbles, suggesting a bustling and attractive in-store sale that people are eager to participate in. On the right side, a screenshot shows an online shop's social media post advertising \"SALE 50% OFF ONLY TODAY!\" with a single, unenthusiastic comment. The humor comes from the contrast between the enthusiasm for an in-store sale and the underwhelming online reaction, poking fun at the difference in",
    "20240101_173308_ORIG_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": "The meme features a \"Yes, But\" format, where on the left side, there's a depiction of anti-aging skincare products suggesting a method for taking care of one's skin and potentially looking younger or maintaining a youthful appearance. On the right side, it humorously contrasts the beneficial skincare products with a line of \"bottles\" marked with symbols suggesting unhealthy habits or lifestyle choices, such as late nights, lots of caffeine, and energy drinks, with a trash can overflowing with these items, which implies sleep deprivation and possibly a stressful lifestyle. This suggests that while the person might be using skincare, the other habits are counterproductive",
    "20240101_182625_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The meme you're referring to displays a humorous contrast between two images. On the left, there is a snow globe with a miniature cityscape labeled \"NEW YORK,\" and on the right, there's a close-up of a label on the bottom of the globe that says \"MADE IN CHINA.\" The punchline of the meme is the juxtaposition of the iconic New York City, typically associated with American culture and commodities, being manufactured in China, highlighting the global nature of production and commerce where goods associated with one country are often produced in another.",
    "20240101_173605_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The meme presents a humorous comparison. On the left, there's an image of a cactus with a sign that says \"FREE HUGS,\" which is a play on the idea that nobody would want to hug a cactus because it is prickly and would hurt. On the right, there's an illustration of individuals being lured towards a sign that says \"FREE WIFI,\" despite the sign being attached to a large, menacing spider. The joke is that while people might avoid free hugs from a cactus, they are so drawn to free Wi-Fi that they would ignore the danger of the spider, satirizing our society's",
    "20240101_173341_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The meme shows a play on the \"Yes, But\" format. On the left side, there's an image that symbolically represents something positive with a big \"YES,\" and on the right side, there's a contrasting image with a \"BUT\" that adds a twist or a complication to the initial positive statement. The punchline is in the juxtaposition of these two images, with the right side image often undermining or humorously altering the context of the left side image. Unfortunately, I cannot describe the specific details of the images, but typically the humor comes from the expectation set by the first image and the surprise or twist presented"
