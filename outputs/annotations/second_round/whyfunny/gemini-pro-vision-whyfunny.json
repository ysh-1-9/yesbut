The right panel is a photograph of a real landscape with a setting sun and a large number of power lines. The caption on the left panel is \"Yes,\" and the caption on the right panel is \"But.\"\n\nThe humor in this image comes from the contrast between the two panels.

However, when presented with a group that is largely made up of diverse demographics (in this case signified by the multi-colored hair) it becomes much harder to pick out the ones that are the same (the blue haired people). This is a satirical commentary on how easy it is for humans to categorize and discriminate against others based on superficial differences, and how difficult it can be to recognize",

It is poking fun at the fact that some vegans are very strict about what they eat, but they don't always consider the other products they use that may also be tested on animals. Tattoo ink is one example of a product that is often tested on animals. The image shows a vegan holding a bottle of tattoo ink and looking at it with a surprised expression. This is because they have just realized that the tattoo ink they are using has been tested on animals. The image is satirical because it is pointing out the hypocrisy of some vegans who are very strict about what they eat, but they",

The pie chart is meant to be satirical because it shows that people are more likely to say yes to something if it is presented in a visually appealing way, even if they don't actually want it. The image is also funny because it shows that people are more likely to say yes to something if it is presented in a way that makes them feel like they are part of a group.",

The image on the left is a woman holding up a dress to show off her figure, while the image on the right is a woman with a price tag on her chest. This suggests that women are often seen as objects to be bought and sold and that their worth is determined by their physical appearance. The image is satirical because it exaggerates this objectification to the point of absurdity. The price tag on the woman's chest suggests that she is for sale, and the fact that she is holding up a dress shows that she is trying to make herself more attractive",

The woman in the image is sitting on a toilet but taking a selfie with a weird angle to try and make her look good for social media. In reality, we all know that no one looks good when taking a selfie on the toilet.

    "20240101_173024_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows how people will readily accept someone with tattoos on their arms, but will be put off by someone with hairy arms. This suggests that society has a double standard when it comes to body modifications. It is also satirical because it shows how people will often say one thing but do another. For example, people may say that they are accepting of people with tattoos, but then they will still be uncomfortable around them. This image is a reminder that we should be more accepting of people who are different from us.",

This could be interpreted in a number of ways, but it is generally seen as a way of expressing disagreement or reservation.\n\nThe image is considered to be satirical because it highlights the way in which people often say \"yes\" to something, but then immediately follow it up with a \"but.\" This can be seen as a way",

The image is saying that boxing is not always about winning or losing, but can also be about the pain and suffering that the fighters go through. The image is also satirical because it shows the referee as a happy man, while the boxer is shown as a beaten man. This is because the referee is not the one who is getting hurt, while the boxer is the one who is suffering.

This contrast highlights how beauty is often an illusion created by artifice and how it can be difficult to achieve and maintain.

The players are initially celebrating the goal, but then are shown to be disappointed when the referee makes the decision to disallow the goal.

    "20240101_180751_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny and satirical because it is making fun of the way some people eat \"healthy\" food.

    "20240101_173144_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows a woman working out on an elliptical machine, sweating and looking like she's putting in a lot of effort. But then, in the next panel, we see her taking the elevator up to the gym, which suggests that she's not actually that interested in working out. It's a satirical commentary on how people often talk about how much they love working out, but then they don't actually put in the effort when it comes time to do it.",
    "20240101_174134_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny and satirical because it shows how relationships have changed over time. In the past, men were expected to be the ones to take the initiative in a relationship and woo women. However, as the image shows, this is no longer the case. Women are now just as likely to take the initiative and ask men out on dates. The image is also satirical because it shows how men are often portrayed as being afraid of commitment and marriage. The man in the image is shown running away from a woman who is offering him a gift. This is because men are often seen as being commitment-phobes and afraid of being tied",
    "20240101_173712_STICK_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " It's funny because in the first picture, the woman is holding a lipstick and looking in the mirror, while in the second picture, there is a bunch of drink options. So it's like saying \"Yes, I'm getting ready to go out, but I'm also bringing my drinks with me.\"",

    "20240101_175738_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because the man is celebrating while looking at a graph that is showing a downward trend. The graph is showing that whatever the man is celebrating is actually going down.

    "20240101_173039_STICK_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it plays on the stereotype that gay men are always trying to get married. The image shows two men, one of whom is proposing to the other. The caption says \"Yes, but...\" which suggests that the man being proposed to is hesitant to accept. This is funny because it plays on the stereotype that gay men are always eager to get married, even if they're not sure about their partner.",
    "20240101_180626_ORIG_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows the struggle of finding the right remote control to turn on the TV. \nThe image is satirical because it shows how there are so many remotes these days, and it can be hard to keep track of which one is for what.",
    "20240101_173239_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny and satirical because it shows the difference between what a woman is supposed to do when she is in a car and what she actually does or would like to do while in a car. This image is funny because it is relatable to many women who have experienced the same thing. This image is also satirical because it shows the absurdity of the expectation that women should always be ladylike and\u6dd1\u5973\u3002",
    "20240101_180407_ORIG_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " This image shows a common occurrence in the fall: leaves falling from trees. However, the image is made humorous by the fact that the leaves are shaped like dogs and they are peeing. This creates a comical and absurd scene.",
    "20240101_175554_STICK_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it is a visual representation of the phrase 'yes, but.' The first panel of the image shows a person skiing down a mountain. This is an example of something that is good. The second panel shows the same person skiing down the mountain, but they are now wearing a bag over their head. This is an example of something that is bad. The image is funny because it shows how one small change (in this case, putting a bag over one's head) can have a big impact on the outcome of a situation. The image is also satirical because it makes fun of the way that people often",
    "20240101_174540_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is a satire on how people are quick to cheer for someone who is winning, but are also quick to turn on them when they start losing. This is seen in the way that the crowd is cheering wildly for the boxer in the first panel, but then in the second panel, they have turned their backs on him and are booing him. This is a common occurrence in sports, where fans are quick to cheer for the winning team, but are just as quick to turn on them when they start losing.",
    "20240101_173800_ORIG_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows how even though someone has a fast pass, they still have to wait in line. It makes fun of the idea of a \"fast pass\" not actually being that fast.",

    "20240101_175259_STICK_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image shows a child in a room full of toys, but the child is sitting on a toy car and looking at the wall with a serious expression on their face. It shows that children would rather play with the boxes the toys come in than the toys themselves.",
    "20240101_172400_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " Because even though the image says yes, the picture of the traffic light shows that the pedestrians and bikers are red, which means stop while cars go. But for the second image, the picture shows that the traffic light for cars is red, but the pedestrian light is green, which means they can go (penis joke).",
    "20240101_175445_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows the disparity between how much money professional athletes make compared to how much regular people make. The image also suggests that professional athletes often come from wealthy families and have an easy time getting ahead in life, while regular people have to work hard and struggle to make ends meet.",
    "20240101_174842_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is meant to show the absurdity of some airplane safety instructions.\n\nFor example, the instructions tell you to put on your oxygen mask before helping others, but the image shows that the oxygen mask is attached to the seat, so you would have to take it off to help someone else. Furthermore, the image shows a passenger leisurely sliding down the emergency slide with his luggage, suggesting that the emergency slide is not as dangerous as it is made out to be.",
    "20240101_180509_ORIG_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows a home recording studio with a lot of expensive equipment, but the hand and finger reaching into the picture are clearly in an office environment.

This is a humorous play on the idea of a \"professional\" home recording studio.",

The image is also a commentary on the way that the wealthy are often able to avoid the consequences of their actions, while the poor are often punished for the same crimes.",
    "20240101_182333_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny and satirical because it shows how even though we have these new technological advancements to make our lives easier, we still find ways to do things the hard way. For example, in the image, the person is using a regular vacuum cleaner to clean the floor, even though there is a robot vacuum cleaner right there. This is funny because it shows how we are resistant to change and how we sometimes prefer to do things the way we're used to, even if it's not the most efficient way.",

The image shows a person wearing a smartwatch that is tracking their steps.

This is a satirical take on the way that technology is increasingly being used to track and monitor people's movements and activities.",
    "20240101_173401_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is satirical because even though the woman in the picture is showing that she is cold, pulling down her sweater, the small picture shows that she has a hand warmer on her.
