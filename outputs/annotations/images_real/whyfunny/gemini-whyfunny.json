In this case, the image pokes fun at the fact that many people are quick to say yes to things without thinking about the consequences, even when it would be better to say no. The image shows how ridiculous it would be to say yes to everything, and how it is important to think before you speak. Or it may poke fun at the high price of walnuts.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-32-02-867_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is taken from the point of view of someone who is standing in front of a fence. There are two signs on the fence. The first sign is in French and says \"Attention! Danger! No trespassing\" and the second sign is in English and says \"Yes, but\". This image is trying to be clever by pointing out the contradiction between the two signs. The French sign is telling people that they are not allowed to enter, while the English sign is saying they are.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-32-32-066_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme where the word \"BUT\" is written on the cat's carrier and \"YES\" on the the cat's bed. The cat appears to be pondering something, with the text in the image playing on this idea with the words \"yes\" and \"but.\"",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-33-45-480_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme which shows a cat sitting in a cat house which has \"Yes\" written on one side and \"But\" written on the other. The cat is sitting in the \"But\" side, which implies that it is a \"but\" cat. This is funny because it is a reference to the common phrase \"yes, but...\", which can be used to express a number of different things, such as agreement with reservations, or the idea that something is not as simple as it seems.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-23-34-433_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a photograph of a Western Union storefront with two signs on the door frame on either side. The sign on the right says \"YES\" while the one on the left says \"NO BUT\". The text on the glass in between the signs reads \"WESTERN UNION\" but the \"N\" has fallen off leaving \"WESTER UIO\".\n\nThe image is likely intended to point out the absurdity of a business having two signs right next to each other that appear to contradict each other and with the missing \"N\", it can be read as \"YES BUT Wester UIO\", which makes the text nonsensical.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-23-08-044_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme. It shows two cats. The first one is a cute kitten accompanied by the word \"YES!\". The second cat is also cute, but has scratch marks on its arm and is accompanied by the word \"BUT\". The meme is comparing the two kittens, suggesting that the second kitten might be cute, but is a little bit naughty.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-32-17-608_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a screenshot of an Instagram story. The story is a photo of a box of coffee. The text on the box says \"Yes, But\". The image is funny because of the visual pun. The coffee box says \"Yes, But\" which is a homophone of \"Yes, Butt.\" The image is satirical because it is making fun of marketing language.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-21-58-588_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows two pictures of the same scene: a woman standing in front of a sign on the left, and a lifeguard sitting on a tower looking out at the sea on the right. However, the two signs have different messages: the sign in the left one says \"Do not enter\" and the sign on the right says \"No fire\". Therefore the lifeguard is ignoring the \"no fire\" rule. Additionally, the lifeguard is wearing a bathing suit and sitting in a lifeguard chair, suggesting that she is on duty and should be paying attention to the safety of others, but she is not.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-33-36-596_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme playing on the phrase \"yes, but.\" The word yes is photoshopped onto a yellow cat bed with a cat laying on it. The word but is photoshopped below the cat. The image is satirical because it implies that the cat is saying \"yes, but\" to something, which is a common phrase used to express a sarcastic or insincere agreement.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-24-49-909_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny and satirical because it shows a cat looking sad and sitting in a cardboard box even though it has a fancy cat tree to sit on. The image is humorous because it shows that the cat would rather sit in a box than use the expensive cat tree. The image is also satirical because it shows how cats are finicky and often do not appreciate the expensive items that are bought for them.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-23-32-123_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a play on words. It contrasts the Spanish word \"S\u00ed\" (meaning \"yes\") with the English word \"But.\" The image also includes two photographs of a sign that reads \"Prohibido botar basura\" (\"Littering is prohibited\"). The first photo has the word \"S\u00ed\" written on it, and the second has the word \"But\" written on it. The contrast between the two words and the two photos suggests that the speaker is expressing a sense of irony or absurdity.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-33-30-375_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The word \"yes\" has been written on a bed, and the word \"but\" has been written next to a cat. The word \"yes\" is written on a bed because yes sounds similar to \"yeast,\" which is a type of fungus that people use to make bread. This is why the word \"yes\" has been placed on a bed. The word \"but\" has been placed next to a cat because cats usually say \"meow\". The words \"yes\" and \"but\" have been used in this image to make a joke.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-22-57-007_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme which uses a photo of a smug looking white cat staring directly at the camera.

    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-24-03-642_com.instagram.android.jpg": " This image is a humorous play on the common phrase \"Yes, but...\" It features a cat sitting in a sink with water pouring over its head. The cat appears to be saying \"Yes, but...\" and the image is intended to be humorous because of the absurdity of the situation. \n\nThe image could also be interpreted as a commentary on how people often use the phrase \"Yes, but...\" to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. The cat in the image could be seen as a representation of a person who is trying to avoid taking responsibility for something they have done.\nOverall, the image is humorous and satirical and could be interpreted in a variety of ways.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-32-46-586_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny because it is a play on words and a commentary on social media ads. The text on the image says \"But not an ad\" and in the caption the says \"Sponsored.\" This is funny because it is self-contradictory and because it's an ad disguised as a non-ad.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-24-05-812_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows a sign that says \"Yes\" and points in one direction, and then there are two girls standing in the other direction with a sign saying \"but\". The implication is that the first sign is saying \"Yes, you can go this way\", and the girls are saying \"but we want to go this way\". \n\nThis is a play on the common phrase \"yes, but\", which is often used to express a concession or a counterargument. In this case, the girls are using the phrase to express their disagreement with the sign. They are saying that they want to go in a different direction, even though the sign says they should go in the opposite direction.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-26-06-387_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme that shows a dog in a bed with the text \"BUT YES\" superimposed on it.

    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-25-18-449_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a screenshot of a convenience store shelf where a bottle of Starbucks' \"Signature Chocolate Dream\" drink is placed in front of a \"Yes, but\" sign, while a green tea drink is placed in front of a \"Yes\" sign. Since the Starbucks drink is placed in front of the \"Yes, but\" sign, the image implies that the person who placed the drink there is trying to make a pun - that the drink is a \"yes\" but with some reservations or conditions. By contrast, the green tea drink is placed in front of a regular \"Yes\" sign, signifying that the person considers the drink to be a \"yes\" without any reservations.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-25-47-884_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a play on words and a well known internet meme. It is a picture of a can of tuna labeled \"yes\" next to a tab that is labeled \"but\" which when put together sound like the common phrase \"yes, but\".",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-24-26-942_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image features a 20L container with a yellow label that says \"yes, but...\"  It's a play on words that implies that this product is easy to open, but then it isn't, and the \"but\" part of the label obscures the actual instructions to open it. This is funny because it shows how companies often use deceptive packaging to trick consumers into buying their products.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-27-02-489_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme comparing a cute cartoon pig to a realistic, muscular depiction of the Minotaur from Greek mythology. The humor lies in the contrast between the two images, as well as the absurdity of a pig being compared to a fearsome creature like the Minotaur. Additionally, the image is captioned, \"Yes, but,\" which implies that even though the pig does not look like the Minotaur, it still possesses some of the same qualities, such as strength and courage.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-33-41-327_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a satirical play on the phrase \"yes, but.\" It shows a bush with the word \"yes\" written on it, but with the word \"but\" written on the ground in front of it. This is a visual representation of the phrase \"yes, but...\", which is often used to express a negative or dismissive response to something. In this image, \"yes\" and \"but\" are separated and presented in a way that highlights their opposition, which pokes fun at the phrase's common usage of \"but\" to negate or diminish the initial \"yes.\"",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-25-05-282_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a pizza shop sign with the word \"Pizza\" written on it. The letter 'P' is missing; however, it is still readable as \"pizza\" due to context.\n\nThe image is humorous because the word \"But\" precedes the word \"Pizza\" in separate signs. The pizza shop was likely trying to convey \"Yes\" with the first sign and \"But\" with the second sign. Thus the phrase reads \"Yes, but pizza\". It is funny because it is nonsensical in this arrangement.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-32-38-272_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme. It is a photo of a cat sitting on a ledge outside a window, with text that says \"YES\" to the left and \"BUT\" to the right. The text is a reference to the common phrase \"yes, but...\", which is often used to express a negative or skeptical response to something. The image is humorous because it plays on this phrase, suggesting that the cat is thinking \"yes, I'm sitting on this ledge, but I'm not sure why\".",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-22-16-966_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a satirical meme that uses word play to alter common phrases into humorous yet nonsensical sentences.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-24-54-542_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a satire of food presentation on social media. The first image in the post shows a beautifully plated meal with the caption \"YES\" while the second image shows the same meal, now\u6b8b\u9ab8, with the caption \"BUT\". It is humorous because it shows the reality of what happens to food after it is posted on social media. The pristine presentation in the first image is a fa\u00e7ade and the second image shows the true, messy aftermath of enjoying a meal.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-25-07-695_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny because it is an example of someone saying one thing but then immediately contradicting with their actions. The text in the image says \"Yes, but.\" The image shows a bridge with the first part labeled \"Yes\" and the second part labeled \"But,\"  The two contradict each other creating a humorous juxtaposition and contradiction.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-27-12-390_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme comparing two pictures of a woman. The first picture shows the woman's outfit from the waist-up, and she is wearing a revealing top with part of her breasts exposed. The second picture shows the woman's full outfit, and it is revealed that she is actually wearing a pair",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-22-04-343_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme which shows two pictures, one of a neat and organized computer desktop and another with a messy and unorganized desktop. Above each image are the words \"YES\" and \"BUT!\" respectively. The subtext of the image says \"krupa_kira reality\".\n\nThe image is likely intended as a satire on the unrealistic expectations of productivity and organization that people often have for themselves.\n\nThe humor of the image lies in the contrast between the two images and the accompanying text. The first image is of an immaculate, perfectly organized desktop, while the second is of a cluttered, chaotic desktop. The text \"YES\" above the first image and \"BUT!\" above the second image suggests that the first image is the ideal and the second image is reality. This contrast is humorous because it plays on the idea that most people's desktops are closer to the second image than the first.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-22-22-174_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a memetic play on the \"Yes, but\" phrase structure commonly used during debates (especially online) where one party, after their point has been refuted, concedes the point but immediately tacks on a counterpoint with \"Yes, but...\" The counterpoint typically includes a pivot to a new, adjacent area of critique that avoids giving ground or admitting fault. It has become a subject of mockery online.\n\nHere, the meme is a visual representation of the phrase in the form of a sarcastic road sign. A pedestrian crosswalk is painted on the paved road, but the words \"Yes,\" and \"But\" are comically painted on the road before and after the crosswalk. It humorously suggests that pedestrians crossing the crosswalk are engaging in a \"Yes, but\" debate. The absurdity of such a debate is a satirical commentary on the frustrating nature of these interactions on the Internet.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-32-05-687_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny because \"Yes, but\" followed by \"But\" forms a tautology, a nonsensical statement that is true by definition. It is a satire of the way people often use the phrase \"yes, but\" to dismiss or qualify their agreement with something, when in fact they actually disagree. It can also be interpreted as a statement that nothing is perfect, even a phrase like \"Yes.\"",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-32-49-303_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows Henry Cavil, who played superman, on a motorcycle wearing a shirt that says \"Yes\". Behind him is a truck with a YES bumper sticker. This is a reference to the phrase \"Yes, but\" as a punchline, or humorous non-sequitur, like the bumper sticker itself. Additionally, the image may be humorous because he is wearing a superman shirt but has a regular license plate instead of a vanity plate like \"SUPERMAN\". Lastly, the image is humorous because the phrase \"Yes, but\" is often used to indicate a compromise with an implied prior statement. In this case, it can be seen as a funny juxtaposition of ideas that the motorcyclist identifies with Superman, but \"Yes, but\" drives a regular car.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-25-21-305_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows two signs that contradict each other. One sign says \"Yes, but\" with an arrow pointing left, while the other sign says \"But\" with an arrow pointing right. The text on the signs also appears to be written in a joking manner, with the first sign saying \"Hachiko Gate Exit A0-8\" and the second sign saying \"Hachiko Gate Exit A8-12\".",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-26-43-575_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny because it plays on the words \"yes\" and \"but.\" The sign on the left says \"Please wait to be seated,\" and the sign on the right says \"No rules.\" So it's like the image is saying that the rules say you have to wait to be seated, but there are no rules, so you can do whatever you want. It's a clever play on words, and it's also a bit satirical because it's poking fun at the way that rules are often made and enforced.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-25-53-535_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a carton of milk with the word \"Yes\" printed on the front. The milk is from a company called \"Tej,\" which is a Hungarian word for milk. The carton has a straw sticking out of it, and the straw is labeled \"But.\" The image is humorous because it is a play on words that references the common philosophical question, \"Yes, but what if...?\" It can also be seen as a commentary on the endless cycle of questions and answers that often accompany philosophical inquiries. Additionally, the image includes the Instagram handle @\"_yes_but\", which further emphasizes the humorous play on words.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-25-50-525_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a photo of the backside of a ticket for a museum exhibit of Hieronymus Bosch's \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\". It has the words \"Yes, but\" written on the top, so the title reads as \"Yes, but The Garden of Earthly Delights\".\n\nThis is a reference to the common complaint that people often say \"yes, but\" after agreeing to something, and then proceed to list a number of reasons why they can't or won't do it. The image is humorous because it plays on this idea by suggesting that even Hieronymus Bosch's famous painting is not without its flaws.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-25-36-006_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme which shows a flatbed truck carrying a red car on a busy road that says \"_YES BUT_\" in the middle in all capital letters. It is funny because the truck's message and the car's license plate which reads \"YES\" and \"BUT\" respectively, create the punchline \"YES BUT\".",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-22-52-122_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image shows a photo of a cup with a caption that says \"yes, but...\" next to a photo of a cracked phone screen with the caption \"YES BUT.\" This is a play on the phrase \"yes, but,\" which is often used to express a counterargument or objection. The image is humorous because it uses the phrase \"yes, but\" in a literal sense, as a caption for two photos that show the consequences of saying \"yes, but.\" The image is also satirical because it highlights the fact that saying \"yes, but\" is often used to avoid responsibility or to make excuses.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-26-14-884_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows a \"Yes, but\" sign on the left side of an image, and a sign that shows \"Avoid touching\" on the right. The two signs beside each other creates a humorous juxtaposition. The image is satirical because it makes fun of public safety signs and adds a fun twist to the usual \"Yes, but\" phrase.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-33-09-328_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a photograph of a whiteboard with the words \"YES\" and \"BUT\" written on it. The word \"YES\" has been written at the top of the board, and the word \"BUT\" has been added below it, as if in response to the first word. The image is likely intended to convey the idea that what appeared to be a very positive sentiment now has an implied negative sentiment. The image is humorous because it is an absurd non-sequitur.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-23-52-325_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme which shows two photos of the same house. In the first photo, the word \"YES\" is written on the left side of the door. In the second photo, the word \"BUT\" is written on the right side of the door. The text at the top of the image reads \"Yes, but.\" followed by the date April 1st 2022. The word \"BUT\" is also written in the door of the second picture. April 1st is also known as April Fools Day, where pranks are commonly made. This implies that the \"Yes\" sign was changed to a \"But\" sign as a joke related to April Fools Day.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-22-59-904_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is trying to show that although one of the drivers is disabled and has a disabled parking sign on their dashboard, the other is parked in the same spot and is not disabled. The image is trying to show that some people are inconsiderate and do not respect the rights of others.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-26-45-877_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows a sharp contrast between rich and poor. In the image the contrast is represented by a juxtaposition of informal settlement next to a distribution center of Amazon. The distribution center is associated with wealth and luxury because of the popularity of its brand. On the contrary, the informal settlement is associated with poverty and crime.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-24-56-769_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is of a bottle of water that is labeled as \"story of my life.\" It is displayed on a shelf next to a bunch of other water bottles. The water bottle is also labeled \"yes but.\" This image is funny and satirical on at least two levels. First, it is a commentary on our increasingly materialistic culture, where we are constantly bombarded with messages about how we need to buy things in order to be happy. Second, the phrase \"story of my life\" is often used to describe someone's life story, but here it is simply used to describe a bottle of water. This contrast between the two meanings of the phrase adds to the humor of the image.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-26-57-484_com.instagram.android.jpg": " This image shows two nearly identical fire extinguishers. One is red, and one is painted in a rainbow of colors. The text on the rainbow extinguisher says that it can't be used for electrical fires. The image implies that fire extinguishers are bigoted.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-26-55-358_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is humorous because it shows a juxtaposition of a serious-looking bulldog in the foreground of the image, which is wearing a party hat and has the word \"BUT\" imposed on it next to an empty dog bed with the word \"YES\" imposed on it. The image is satirical because by using the dog as a prop, it shows the silliness of political discourse and the inability to agree, or compromise, as shown by the dog beds, even when the issue is simple.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-22-49-979_com.instagram.android.jpg": " It shows a juxtaposition of two images. The first image shows a beautiful view of a city and a frozen river that has the words \"no war\" written on it. The second image shows a close-up of one of the ice floes, and the Cyrillic text in the graffiti translates to \"but.\" This image is funny because of the contrast between the large, bright, and optimistic text of the first photo and the small, dark, and pessimistic text of the second photo. Additionally, both photos are covered in melting ice, which is symbolic and emphasizes that even the most optimistic and positive things can melt away quickly and unexpectedly.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-31-42-392_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny because it is an example of a dog meme, which is a popular form of humor on the internet. The meme typically uses a photo of a dog in various situations, accompanied by text in the top and bottom of the image. The text is often nonsensical, but it can also be used to make a point or to express a humorous opinion. In this case, the text is simply \"Yes\" and \"But,\" which is funny because it is nonsensical and unexpected.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-23-21-132_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme that is in a format similar to popular \"Yes, but\" meme format. It's funny because the sign says \"Yes\" but the sign under it says \"But\" and there is a bike lane with the \"No Bicycles\" sign going through it. In other words, it's nonsensical.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-22-44-299_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a meme that is referencing a quote by US vice president Kamala Harris during a 2021 interview on NPR:\n> But we want to make clear to Russia that there will be severe consequences if they were to go in.\n\nThe meme compares this quote to the actual invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022. The meme suggests that despite US attempts at deterrence, Russia decided to invade Ukraine anyway, as evidenced by the invasion itself. The humor is derived from contrasting the US warnings of \"severe consequences\" against the reality of Russia's invasion.",

The package on the left is labeled \"YES\", and the package on the right is labeled \"BUT.\" The image is funny/satirical because it is a visual representation of the phrase \"yes, but\" which people usually say before they give a negative response. In this case, the person who created this image is playing with language and visual representation in a way that is both humorous and thought-provoking..",

The words \"yes\" and \"but\" are written on the steps in an arrangement that makes it look like \"yes, but\". This is a common phrase used to express agreement with a condition or reservation. The image is humorous because it takes this phrase literally and shows the words \"yes\" and \"but\" on separate steps, as if they are two people having a conversation. The image is also a commentary on the way that language can be used to express different meanings.",

When the customer, August Regalado, purchased the two shirts, he noticed the mistake and used a marker to change one of the Yes, But's to \"Yes\" and the other to \"But,\" emphasizing the unintended, humorous design. \n\nAlternatively, Yes and But are two opposing words.

Next to the bowl that is on the paper that says \"YES\" is another paper with a handwritten note written in large letters that says \"BUT\". Therefore, the dog appears to have chosen to eat his food based on the words \"YES\" and \"BUT\", which when put together \"YES, BUT\" implies that the dog likes the food in the bowl labeled \"YES\" and dislikes the food that is on the ground labeled \"BUT\".\nThe meaning of the meme itself is left up to interpretation but can be interpreted many different ways whether it be just a dog making a simple choice or a commentary on humans making decisions based on words instead of trying something new.",

This is a common format for memes, and the humor of this meme comes from the contrast between the two dogs.

    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-25-33-184_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is likely intended to be humorous or satirical because it features text that contradicts itself. The sign reads \"Yes, but no parking,\" which is nonsensical. The image also includes a QR code that is nonsensical and unreadable. In addition, it appears that the sign has intentionally been zip tied to make it more permanent.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-24-52-509_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image on the left is of a typical security camera, while the one on the right is of a Nest camera. Nest is well known to have poor customer service and requires a monthly/yearly fee to use its cloud video storage. The image is poking fun at the fact that a Nest camera could potentially be watching you, even if you're a paying customer.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-23-36-644_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image shows two signs that say \"yes\" and \"but\" on each side of a ramp for people in wheelchairs that is blocked. The word \"yes\" is on the lower ground while the word \"but\" is on the higher ground. This creates a contrast between the words, and shows how despite the sign saying \"yes\" (meaning that people in wheelchairs can use the ramp), the ramp is unusable due to the words \"but,\" meaning that the the ramp is inaccessible.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-26-29-969_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows a golden retriever dog lying on top of a \"No Dogs Allowed\" sign. It's as if the dog is saying, \"Yes, but...\" and then the dog is lying on the \"but\" part of the sign.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-23-48-965_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a satire showing how people these days are glued to their phones, even when in public areas. One person in the image is walking while holding a large piece of luggage in one hand and staring at their phone with the other. The text of the image reads \"YES\" above the person and \"BUT\" below them. Below the image, it says, \"@YES BUT,\" which is a commentary on how people are always saying yes to technology.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-33-00-880_com.instagram.android.jpg": " The image is a memetic juxtaposition of two photos. The upper photo forbids the parking of mopeds, but there isn't one parked there. But below that sign saying \"but\" there is a moped parked. This is satire because it is absurd to have a sign prohibiting mopeds, but then have a moped parked in the same place where the prohibition applies.",
    "images_real/Screenshot_2024-05-23-20-25-45-267_com.instagram.android.jpg": " This image is a satire because it shows how ridiculous a hypothetical Instagram post would be with 222 likes despite getting 0 views just a minute after posting. This is not possible in real life, but it is a clever way to show how meaningless social media metrics like likes and views can be."
