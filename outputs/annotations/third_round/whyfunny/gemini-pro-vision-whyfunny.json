    "20240101_174757_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows the contrast between two people's reactions to a nuclear explosion. The woman in the cafe is sitting calmly and drinking her coffee while the woman in the office is panicking and running away. This is a satirical commentary on how people often react to unexpected events. Some people are able to stay calm and collected while others panic and lose their heads.",
    "20240101_175339_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny and satirical because it is unexpected.  The first image is a diagram of fitted sheet. It is labeled \"Yes.\" The second image is a man staring at a messy bed. It is labeled \"But.\" The humor lies in the contrast between the two images. The first image is neat and orderly, while the second image is messy and chaotic. The caption \"Yes, but\" suggests that the man is trying to make the bed, but is struggling with the fitted sheet. The image is a clever play on words and a reminder that things are not always as easy as they seem.",
    "20240101_181143_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because even though there is a \"No Parking\" sign, the cars are still parked in the \"No Parking\" zone.",
    "20240101_174540_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because the two images contradict each other. The first image depicts a boxer being celebrated, while the second image shows the same boxer with a black eye and a bloody nose, indicating that he has been in a fight. The juxtaposition of these two images suggests that the boxer has won the fight, but at a great cost. This is a satirical take on the notion of victory, and how it is often accompanied by pain and suffering.",
    "20240101_173308_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows two different types of products that are often marketed to people as being healthy or beneficial, but in reality, they are not. The first type of product is beauty products which are often marketed to women and promise to make them look younger or more beautiful. However, many of these products contain harsh chemicals that can actually damage the skin. The second type of product is energy drinks which are often marketed to young people and promise to give them more energy. However, these drinks are often loaded with sugar and caffeine, which can actually have negative effects on health.",
    "20240101_175722_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image shows a woman wearing a hijab and gloves, holding what appears to be salt, while another person holds out their arm. The implication is that the person in the hijab is about to throw salt at them. The image is captioned \"Yes, but,\" which suggests that the person in the hijab is hesitant to throw the salt, or is doing so as a last resort. This image is funny/satirical because it uses an unexpected and humorous image to illustrate a common experience. Many people have been in a situation where they have felt like they needed to do something, but were hesitant to do so. The image captures this",
    "20240101_181009_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows the struggle of trying to remember a password. The person in the image is trying to login to their account but is unable because they have forgotten their password. The image shows the absurdity of having to create a strong password that you will inevitably forget.",
    "20240101_175126_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is a play on the words \"yes\" and \"but.\" The first panel shows a cup of coffee with a heart-shaped design in the foam. The second panel shows a hand stirring a cup of coffee. The caption \"Yes, but\" suggests that the person in the second panel is not satisfied with the coffee and is adding something to it. Another interpretation of this image is that the first panel is an expectation of what is going to happen and the second panel is the reality of the situation.",
    "20240101_173119_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny and satirical because it shows how despite us being able to communicate with each other easily, we still have trouble understanding each other. It highlights the fact that sometimes, even when we think we're saying the same thing, we can still be worlds apart. In this image, the black cat is what both parties agree on, but the \"Russian Blue Cat\" that is delivered is far from the original. It's almost like they weren't speaking the same language to begin with.",
    "20240101_180335_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because on the left side it shows a western woman sitting at a table with wine and utensils while on the right side a woman who is wearing a hijab is eating with chopsticks and spilling her food. This is satirical because it is poking fun at the stereotype that westerners eat with utensils while middle easterners eat with their hands.",
    "20240101_175608_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny/satirical because even though the players are celebrating a goal, the referee's flag is up for offside so the goal won't actually count.",
    "20240101_182426_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows two very clean and minimal computer desktops. Both are white, uncluttered, and have a single window open. One has an organized app layout, while the other is a typical messy desk with food and garbage covering the entire surface. The image is satirical because it shows how our digital spaces can be pristine and organized, while our physical spaces can be chaotic and cluttered.",
    "20240101_180509_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it shows a music producer making electronic music in \"the box\" (using only software plugins) and the other is using hardware synthesizers/drum machines/etc. The image pokes fun at the idea that electronic musicians who use only software are not \"real\" musicians.",
    "20240101_173039_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it shows the hypocrisy of some people who are quick to support a cause or group of people in public but are not willing to do the same in private. The image shows two men holding hands in the shadows, away from the public eye. The caption could read: \"In public, they're all for equality, but in private, they're not so sure.\" It is a reminder that not everyone who claims to be an ally is always willing to stand up for what they believe in when it matters.",
    "20240101_174200_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is satirical because it's a play on the phrase \"yes, but.\" It's a way of saying \"yes, but there's a catch.\" In this case, the catch is that the woman is smiling, but her eyes are sad. This suggests that she's not really happy, even though she's trying to put on a happy face.\n\nThis image is funny because it's relatable. We've all been in situations where we've had to put on a happy face, even though we're not really feeling it. It's a reminder that we're not",
    "20240101_180758_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " This image shows a black rope and a black cat on a couch. The word \"yes\" is placed next to the image of the rope, and the word \"but\" is placed next to the image of the cat. This satirical image implies that if you give a cat a piece of rope, it will not be used for its intended purpose.",
    "20240101_174518_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " It shows how people have the freedom to choose but are still confined by societal norms and expectations.",
    "20240101_172325_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it uses a pun about \"tree\" and \"three.\" The punchline is that, in the second panel, one bird asks the other what kind of tree it is, and the other bird responds with \"it's a yes tree\" because the first bird only asked if it was a \"yes\" or a \"no.\"",
    "20240101_175353_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny and satirical because it shows two different perspectives on life, one positive and one negative. The positive perspective is represented by the caption \"Yes,\" which is accompanied by an image of a door opening up to a bright and sunny day. The negative perspective is represented by the caption \"But,\" which is accompanied by an image of a person drowning in a dark and stormy sea. The image is humorous because it highlights the contrast between the two perspectives and shows how our attitude can greatly impact our outlook on life.",
    "20240101_174029_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it is an example of black comedy, which uses dark and often taboo subjects to elicit humor. The image itself is a play on the classic \"Yes, but\" joke format, with the first panel showing a seemingly wholesome image of a woman harvesting carrots with a child, and the second panel revealing a more sinister scene of a rabbit being tortured. This contrast between the two panels creates a sense of absurdity and irony that is characteristic of black comedy. Additionally, the use of dark and disturbing imagery in the second panel serves to subvert the viewer's expectations and create a sense of unease, which further contributes",
    "20240101_173159_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows an everyday situation that is relatable to many. It is satirical because it shows how people often do the opposite of what is best for them. The first panel of the image shows a trash can with the word \"yes\" on it. The second panel shows a hand dropping a piece of paper into a hole in a fence with the word \"but\" on it. This is funny because it shows how people often say \"yes\" to things they do not want to do and \"but\" to things they do want to do.",
    "20240101_180751_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows that healthy food is not always appealing, and that sometimes we have to add unhealthy things to make it more palatable. The image shows a bowl of vegetables with the words \"Yes\" next to it, and then a bowl of vegetables with mayonnaise being poured on it with the words \"But\" next to it. This implies that the vegetables are not very good on their own, and that we need to add something unhealthy to make them more appealing.",
    "20240101_173039_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is comparing two situations. In the first, a man is singing on stage in front of a large crowd. In the second, two men are standing next to each other. The caption on the left says \"YES\". The caption on the right says \"BUT\". The image is satirical because it is making fun of the fact that in our society, being a singer is seen as more important than being in a loving relationship.",
    "20240101_180601_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it is satirical. It is poking fun at the phrase \"yes, but\" which is often used to express a negative or dismissive attitude. In this image, the phrase is used to describe a glass. It is suggesting that the glass is not very good because it is empty. This is a humorous way of poking fun at the phrase \"yes, but\".",
    "20240101_172955_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " It is funny because in the first panel the man is holding a large iced coffee, and in the second panel he is drinking a glass of water. The implication is that the iced coffee is unhealthy and the water is healthy, but the man is still drinking the iced coffee even though he knows it is unhealthy. This is a satire because it shows how people often make unhealthy choices even though they know they should be making healthy choices.",
    "20240101_173542_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows how crowded a \"secret beach\" can be. The signpost is pointing to the beach, but the beach is full of people.",
    "20240101_173043_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because diet soda is often marketed as a healthier alternative to regular soda, but it is still full of sugar and calories. The image shows that even though the person is drinking a diet soda, they are still consuming a lot of unhealthy food.",
    "20240101_174757_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows the absurdity of always looking at the negative side of things. \n\nThe woman on the left is enjoying her coffee and her laptop. She is happy and content, and she is not worried about anything. \n\nThe woman on the right is also enjoying her coffee. She is sitting in front of a mushroom cloud, which suggests that the world is ending. However, she is not worried about the mushroom cloud. She is focused on her work, and she is determined to finish it before the world ends. This image is a reminder that we should not take things for granted.",
    "20240101_172357_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows two different perspectives.  One perspective makes the room look large and spacious, while the other perspective makes it look small and cramped.  This is a common problem in real estate.",
    "20240101_180548_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is satirical because it uses the phrase \"think twice\" in a literal sense. The image shows a man with two earrings in his head. The earrings are connected by a wire that goes down his neck. The image implies that the man has been thinking twice about something, and he has decided to do it. This is funny because it is unexpected. The image is also satirical because it uses the phrase \"think twice\" to comment on the political climate. The image suggests that people are being asked to think twice about their political beliefs. This is funny because it is true. People are often asked to think twice about their political",
    "20240101_174949_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The black dog is holding a shoe in it's mouth. The toys are all black and white and look like shadows. The dog looks like a shadow as well.  The text above the dog says \"Yes, but\". This is funny because people often say \"yes, but\" when they have an objection. Therefore, this image could refer to people who are willing to hear you out but ultimately will not change their mind.",
    "20240101_175331_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image shows a group of people walking their dogs in a park. In the first part of the image, the people are all walking their dogs in different directions, and the dogs are all tangled up in each other. In the second part of the image, the people are all walking their dogs in the same direction, and the dogs are all walking nicely next to each other. The image is funny because it shows how people can be so different when they are walking their dogs. Some people are very careful and make sure that their dogs are not tangled up in each other, while other people are just oblivious to what their dogs are doing",
    "20240101_174213_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows the reality of an off-road vehicle. The ad for the vehicle shows it in a pristine condition, but the reality is that it is more likely to be involved in an accident. This is because off-road vehicles are often driven in rough conditions, and they are more likely to be involved in accidents than other types of vehicles. The image is satirical because it makes fun of the way that off-road vehicles are marketed. The ad for the vehicle shows it as being tough and capable, but the reality is that it is more likely to be involved in an accident.",
    "20240101_173752_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " It's funny because even though the two images are almost identical, they are labeled \"YES\" and \"BUT\". This implies that sometimes a small difference can have a large impact on the meaning of something.",
    "20240101_174518_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it shows how even though we may be aware of the problems in the world, such as an elephant being locked up in a cage or climate change, we often choose to ignore them and instead focus on our own personal problems, such as taking a selfie on top of an elephant. This is a commentary on how people are often more concerned with their own lives than with the world around them.",
    "20240101_180947_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it is referencing the famous internet meme \"Duck, Duck, Goose!\". Instead of saying \"Goose\", the car says \"But\". This is funny because the word \"but\" is often used to express an objection or to contradict something that has been said. In this case, the car is objecting to the fact that it is being called a duck. The image is also satirical because the car is trying to be clever by using wordplay.",
    "20240101_173752_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because the first part is of an electrical outlet that is happy and smiling, and the second part is of a plug that is sad and crying. This is a satire on the fact that it is difficult to find an electrical outlet that is not occupied.",
    "20240101_174927_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it plays on the idea of a \"perfect\" Instagram photo. The woman in the image is taking a picture of herself in the bathroom, and she is using the sink to prop herself up so that she can get a better angle. However, the angle of the photo is such that it makes her look like she is sitting on the toilet. This is a humorous take on the idea of a \"perfect\" Instagram photo, as it shows that even the most carefully posed photos can be deceiving.",
    "20240101_172315_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows the unrealistic expectations of beauty that are often imposed on women. The first image shows a woman wearing a pair of high heels, which are often seen as a symbol of beauty and sophistication. However, the second image shows the reality of wearing high heels, which can often cause pain and damage to the feet. The image is satirical because it highlights the absurdity of these unrealistic expectations and the lengths that women are often willing to go to in order to achieve them.",
    "20240101_174241_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " It is funny because on the right side an Arab man is wearing many shoes and holding even more shoes in his hands while only wearing shorts and a t-shirt. On the left side is a man playing basketball. In this image, the Arab man likely has a lot of money and the man playing basketball is wearing the same color clothes as the basketball. This implies that the basketball player is poor.",
    "20240101_181422_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny and satirical because the woman is blissfully unaware of imminent laptop battery death. The image pokes fun at the inconvenience of technology and how quickly a relaxing day can be derailed by a low battery.",

The implication is that the person who owns the car has spent all of their money on groceries and cannot afford a new sound system.",
    "20240101_173355_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it highlights the difference between the advertised storage space of a phone and the actual\u53ef\u7528\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4. The advertised storage space is often less than the actual\u53ef\u7528\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4, because the operating system and pre-installed apps take up some of the space. This can be frustrating for users who expect to have all of the advertised storage space available to them.",
    "20240101_180515_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows the waiter saying \"yes\" while the picture of the food shows \"but.\" This is a play on the phrase \"yes, but,\" which is often used to express agreement with reservations. In this case, the waiter is saying \"yes\" to the customer's order, but the picture of the food shows that the order is not what the customer expected. This creates a humorous contrast between the waiter's words and the reality of the situation.",
    "20240101_180751_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows a healthy salad with a big \"YES\" next to it.

    "20240101_174757_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows the contrast between an optimistic and pessimistic outlook on life. The optimistic person sees the glass half full, while the pessimistic person sees the glass half empty. This contrast is humorous because it shows how differently two people can view the same situation.\n\nThe image is also satirical because it pokes fun at the way that people often try to find the negative in every situation. The pessimistic person in the image is so focused on the negative that they can't even enjoy their cup of coffee. This is a satirical take on the way that some people always seem to find something to complain about.",
    "20240101_174213_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows how a car can look very different when it is covered in camouflage. The first car is covered in camouflage and looks like a military vehicle. The second car is not covered in camouflage and looks like a regular car. This image is satirical because it shows how camouflage can be used to make something look different than it actually is.",
    "20240101_180751_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image shows a cartoon salad with a person eating it. The image also says \"Yes, but\" which implies that the person is agreeing to eat the salad, but they have a condition.

    "20240101_173729_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows the hypocrisy of people who are always complaining about their spouse.

The woman on the left is taking a proactive approach to her situation, while the woman on the right is taking a more passive approach. The woman on the left is more likely to succeed in her endeavors, while the woman on the right is more likely to fail. This image is satirical because it shows how people can often be so focused on their own problems that they don't see the bigger picture.

He starts by trying to put on an oxygen mask, but he puts it on upside down. Then, he tries to use the phone, but he gets it caught in the cord. Finally, he tries to open the door, but he can't figure out how to do it. The image is satirical because it shows how people often try to be heroes, but they don't always have the skills or knowledge to do so.",
    "20240101_173642 (1)_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny/satirical because it shows a woman carrying a heavy load of items on her head, while the empty cage next to her is labeled \"YES\" and the woman is labeled \"BUT\". This suggests that the woman is burdened with a lot of responsibilities and expectations, while the empty cage represents the freedom and lack of responsibility that she desires. The image is a commentary on the traditional roles of women in many cultures, where they are expected to take on a disproportionate amount of domestic and caregiving responsibilities. It is also a reminder that women are often not given the same opportunities as men to pursue their",
    "20240101_175608_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny/satirical because in many sports, there is often controversy over whether or not a goal should count. The image shows a goal being scored, but the referee is using VAR (video assistant referee) to review the play. The text at the top of the image says \"YES,\" but the text at the bottom says \"NO GOAL,\" indicating that the referee is likely to overturn the call on the field. This is a common source of frustration for fans, as it can often seem like the referees are making decisions based on subjective criteria rather than the actual rules of the game.",
    "20240101_180407_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows the woman considering whether or not to get a dog.

This suggests that while getting a dog can be a positive experience, it also comes with a lot of challenges and responsibilities.",
    "20240101_173308_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows how people's priorities are often out of whack. We spend a lot of money on things that make us look good on the outside, but we neglect our health and well-being. The image shows that people would rather spend money on cigarettes and energy drinks than healthy food and skin care products.",

The second person is further down and is looking at the first person but the second person is much larger than the first person and is looming over them. This could be seen as a metaphor for how people often compare themselves to others and feel inadequate. The image is satirical because it shows how people often strive for something that is unattainable or not worth the effort and also shows how people will put others down to make themselves feel better about their own insecurities.",

The ice completely fills up the cup and the straw is barely visible. The person's expression is obscured by the cup, but it's easy to imagine that they are struggling to drink through all the ice. This image is poking fun at people who fill their cups with so much ice that there's hardly any room for the actual beverage.",

On one hand, people are constantly being told that they should drink more water for their health. On the other hand, there are often long lines for the bathroom, which suggests that drinking more water will actually lead to more problems.

This can be seen as a metaphor for the complexity of modern life and technology. The person with the remotes is overwhelmed and confused, which is how many people feel when trying to operate all of their devices.",
    "20240101_175339_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows how different perspectives can lead to very different interpretations of the same situation. The side-by-side images could be depicting two different people's perspectives on a messy bed. The first person sees the bed as a place to rest and relax, while the second person sees a lot of work that needs to be done.",
    "20240101_175535_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows a juxtaposition between a pair of expensive, limited edition soccer cleats and a person playing soccer. The implication is that the person playing soccer is not very good, and that they would be better off with a cheaper pair of cleats. It is also satirical because it shows how people will often buy expensive, limited edition items, even if they don't need them or don't know how to use them.",

    "20240101_180607_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows the absurdity of the \"Yes, but\" argument. The argument goes like this: \"Yes, women should be allowed to wear whatever they want, but they shouldn't wear something that is too revealing.\" This argument is often used to police women's clothing choices and to justify discrimination against women who wear certain types of clothing.\n\nThe image shows a woman wearing a hijab and a woman wearing a bikini. The text next to the woman in the hijab says \"Yes,\" and the text next to the woman in the bikini says \"But.\" This suggests that the woman in the hijab is doing",
    "20240101_180332_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image shows two different takes on the phrase \"self-care\". It shows how \"self-care\" is often portrayed on social media versus the reality of self-care.",

    "20240101_180832_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it shows how the same amount of stuff fits into a shopping cart as a car trunk, despite the car trunk being much bigger. This suggests that the shopping cart is a more efficient use of space, which is ironic because car trunks are generally considered to be more spacious. The image is also funny because it shows how people often pack their cars full of stuff, even when they don't need to, and that shopping carts can be used for more than just shopping.",
    "20240101_180832_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is satirical because shows how people will splurge on things they don't necessarily need (like a sound system for their car) but will hesitate to buy things they actually need (like groceries).",

The image is satirical because it highlights the absurdity and contradiction of these two statements. The first statement, \"yes\", is a simple affirmative. It is a positive and unconditional statement. The second statement, \"but\", is a negative and conditional statement. It is a statement that is dependent on the first statement. The two statements are contradictory because they are both opposites. The first statement is a positive statement, while the second statement is a negative statement.

This is often used to avoid doing something that the person doesn't want to do.",
    "20240101_174232_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it is a play on words. The phrase \"yes, but\" is often used to express a reluctant agreement.

The image is satirical because it shows how ridiculous it is that people are willing to pay so much for food.",
    "20240101_181009_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny/satirical because creating a strong password can be challenging, and many people resort to using weak passwords that are easy to remember. This can make it easier for hackers to access their accounts. The image shows a person trying to create a strong password, but then they are shown a message that they must enter their username and password. This is a reminder that even if you create a strong password, it is still important to use a unique username and be careful about where you enter your login information.",

All of the people in the crowd have the same blue and black hairstyle.\n\nThe image is funny because it shows how ridiculous the hairstyle would look in real life. The hairstyle is so elaborate that it would be impossible to maintain in real life. Additionally, the hairstyle is so unique that the person wearing it would stand out in a crowd.\n\nThe image is also satirical because it makes fun of the way that people often follow trends. The hairstyle in the image is so ridiculous",
    "20240101_173239_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny/satirical because the woman in the car looks very relaxed and comfortable, while the stick figures in the car next to her are in very uncomfortable positions. This suggests that the woman is not actually paying attention to the road and is instead focused on her own comfort. This is a humorous take on the common stereotype of women being bad drivers.",
    "20240101_173254_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because the two images in the panels are the same image, but the second image has been edited so that the strawberries are all rotten and moldy, with the text \"BUT\" indicating that the second image is the more realistic outcome.",
    "20240101_182549_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows the difference between what people think they will do with a piece of exercise equipment and what they actually do with it. The first image shows a person using an exercise bike, and the second image shows the same exercise bike covered in clothes and shoes, indicating that it is being used as a clothes rack. This is a common occurrence, as many people buy exercise equipment with the intention of using it, but then end up using it for other purposes. The image is satirical because it highlights this discrepancy between people's intentions and their actions.",

    "20240101_182252_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is a play on the popular \"Yes, but\" meme. In this version, the person is getting a tattoo that says \"VEGGAN\" (a play on the word \"vegan\"). However, the tattoo artist reveals that the tattoo ink is not vegan, which makes the tattoo a contradiction.",
    "20240101_174518_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it highlights the hypocrisy of some people who claim to be against animal cruelty but are still willing to exploit animals for their own personal gain. The image shows a man crying over a picture of an elephant in a cage while at the same time, he is riding on an elephant. This suggests that the man is only concerned about the well-being of animals when it is convenient for him and that he is willing to ignore the suffering of animals when it is not.",
    "20240101_173210_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows how ridiculous beauty standards are by using a very literal interpretation of them. The image shows a woman holding a paper with the words \"Beauty Standards\" written on it. The paper lists various measurements for a woman's body, such as height, weight, and bust size. The woman is angry and screaming, and she is tearing the paper apart. This suggests that she is frustrated with the unrealistic and unattainable beauty standards that are imposed on women. The image is satirical because it takes the beauty standards that are often presented as ideal and shows how absurd they are when taken to an extreme.",
    "20240101_174232_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it shows the absurdity of traffic signals for pedestrians. The image shows a pedestrian crossing with a green light for pedestrians, but the pedestrian is still unable to cross the road due to the presence of cars. This is because the cars are not stopping for the pedestrian, even though they are supposed to. The image is satirical because it shows how traffic signals for pedestrians are often ignored by drivers. The image is also funny because it shows how pedestrians are often at the mercy of drivers, even when they have the right of way.",
    "20240101_180319_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it is a play on the common idiom \"yes, but\". It is a visual of the phrase that shows two vases of flowers, one full and the other empty, but the empty vase sits outside of the box, thinking outside the box. The image is meant to show that \"yes, but\" can be a limiting mindset, while thinking outside the box can lead to new possibilities.",
    "20240101_182238_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows how people are often quick to say yes to things, but then they come up with a lot of excuses why they can't actually do it.

The image shows a boy feeding a cow, which is a symbol of compassion and love. However, the boy is also eating a hamburger, which is made of beef. This shows that the boy is not actually as compassionate and loving as he appears to be, because he is still willing to eat animals even though he claims to love them.",
    "20240101_173642_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it captures the moment when a person (in this case, the one holding the pizza) is faced with a difficult choice. On one hand, he wants to eat the entire pizza himself. On the other hand, he knows that he has to share it with the dog who is looking at him with such sad eyes. The image captures the internal struggle of the person as he tries to decide what to do.\n\nOn another level, it could point to a more universal human experience of having to make difficult choices and the resulting (often humorous) internal struggle.",

The two images seem to be unrelated at first glance, but upon further inspection, the viewer realizes that the image on the right is made up of dogs in various poses, and the woman's hand on the left perfectly covers her face. The caption \"Yes, but\" suggests that the woman is not happy about something, and the dogs are the cause of her displeasure. The image is satirical because it pokes fun at the way that people often use social media to post carefully curated images of themselves, while hiding their true feelings and thoughts.",

The first person, \"Yes\", is a man who is happily eating a bowl of vegan food. The second person, \"But\", is a woman who is looking at the man in disgust and biting her nails.

The second panel shows a computer with the same landscape as the wallpaper, but the image is split in half and the user is unable to see it in full.

In the other, a man is riding an elephant while taking a selfie. \n\nThe first scenario depicts empathy for the elephant, while the second shows a lack of concern for the animal's well-being.\n\nThis image may be interpreted in a number of ways, but one possible interpretation is that it is a commentary on the cognitive dissonance humans often exhibit in how they treat animals. While many people may claim to care about animals, their actions often suggest otherwise.",

This is a funny play on words because \"secret\" usually means that something is not well-known or not shared with many people. However, the beach in the image is very popular and well-known.

The caption \"Yes\" suggests that he is happy with his setup and that he is ready to start making music.\n\nThe second image shows a close-up of a synthesizer. The caption \"But\" suggests that something might be wrong with the synthesizer. The producer might not be able to figure out how to use it, or it might not be working properly. This is a problem because the producer needs the synthesizer to make music.\n\nThe humor of the image lies in the contrast between the producer's",
    "20240101_174029_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny/satirical because it shows a juxtaposition between the wholesome image of a mother and child picking vegetables from a garden and a more adult image of a rabbit crying tears of blood over the consumption of those same vegetables. This contrast is humorous because it shows the hypocrisy of people who will happily eat meat and other animal products but then turn around and cry foul when they see an animal being hurt.",

    "20240101_175602_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because the two objects shown are a potato peeler and a ginger root. The potato peeler is shown in the \"yes\" category, implying that it is easy to peel a potato. The ginger root is shown in the \"but\" category, implying that it is difficult to peel a ginger root. This is because the potato peeler is designed to peel potatoes, which are soft and easy to peel, while the ginger root is hard and has a knobby, irregular surface that makes it difficult to peel.",

It is satirical because it plays on the stereotype that men with tattoos are hairy.",
    "20240101_180643_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image shows a monopoly board with money. The caption is \"Yes, but\". This is funny because it suggests that money is the most important thing in the game of Monopoly, and that it is the only thing that matters. The image is a satire on the capitalistic nature of the game, and how money is often the only thing that people care about. The image is also a commentary on the fact that money is often the only thing that people care about in real life, and how it is often the only thing that matters in the game of life.",

In the second panel, we see the same picnic, but it is now overrun with flies. The contrast between the two panels is humorous because it shows how quickly a picnic can go from being idyllic to being a nightmare. \n\nIt is also satirical because it shows how quickly things can change and how important it is to be prepared for anything and have a plan in place, even when going on a simple picnic.",
    "20240101_173232_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows the difference between what people say they want and what they actually want. The person on the left is saying that they want to watch TV, but the person on the right is actually watching TV and is overwhelmed by the amount of noise and visual stimulation. This is a common experience for people who watch TV, as they are often bombarded with loud commercials and flashy images. The image is satirical because it makes fun of people who say they want to watch TV but are actually just looking for something to occupy their time.",
    "20240101_175752_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image shows two conflicting ideas about sun protection. The first is that applying sunscreen is the best way to protect the skin from the sun. The second says that the best way to avoid the sun is to ride a scooter with a large umbrella. The comparison of these two ideas is humorous because the large umbrella on the scooter is not practical and does not provide full protection from the sun.",
    "20240101_173552_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image shows two coffee cups and the words \"yes\" and \"but\". The first cup is a full, ceramic cup of coffee with a fancy design on top. The second cup is an empty to-go cup. The image is funny because it plays on the idea of having coffee to-go. The first cup is more trouble than it's worth, requiring extra time and effort to enjoy the coffee. It's fancier but not necessarily better. The second cup is less appealing on the surface but is more efficient and gets straight to the point.",
    "20240101_173317_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows two different perspectives on the same situation. The first perspective is that of a person who sees a small problem and tries to fix it. The second perspective is that of a person who sees a much bigger problem and realizes that there is nothing they can do to fix it. This image is a satire on the way that people often see the world in a very simplistic way and fail to see the bigger picture. It is also a reminder that sometimes, the best thing we can do is to accept the world as it is and not try to change it.",

    "20240101_175558_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it is unexpected. The text \"Yes, but\" is often used to express hesitation or doubt. However, in this image, it is used to express the opposite. The image shows a vegan mayonnaise product being used to season a steak. This is unexpected because vegan mayonnaise is typically used as a condiment for salads or sandwiches, not as a marinade for steak. The juxtaposition of the two items creates a humorous and satirical effect.",
    "20240101_173642_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny/satirical because it shows the hypocrisy of humans when it comes to food. We often say that we love animals, but we still eat them. This image shows a man eating pizza, which is made from the flesh of animals.

The robot on the left is a realistic depiction of a robot, with its bulky body and mechanical parts. The robot on the right is a cartoonish depiction of a robot, with its sleek body and human-like features. The image is satirical because it shows how unrealistic our expectations of robots are. We often imagine robots as being sleek and human-like, but the reality is that they are more likely to be bulky and mechanical.- The image is funny because it shows a robot that is not very useful",

The first image shows a woman holding a 1 sign between two boxers, seemingly indicating that she is the winner. The second image shows the same woman holding a boxing scorecard that indicates that she lost the fight. This is unexpected because it is usually the winner who holds the 1 sign and the loser who holds the scorecard. The image is also satirical because it highlights the absurdity of sexism in the world of boxing. Women are often not taken seriously as boxers, and the image shows how this can lead to them being overlooked for opportunities.",

This is a play on words, because the phrase \"Yes, but\" is often used to indicate that someone is reluctantly agreeing to something. The image is satirical because it makes fun of the way that people often use the phrase \"Yes, but\" to avoid saying no.",

The image shows a woman eating a bowl of noodles while her dog is eating a bowl of dry dog food. The woman is likely very concerned about the ingredients in her dog's food, but she is not as concerned about the ingredients in her food.

The second panel shows a woman, presumably not Muslim, not wearing a hijab and eating with a fork. The caption \"Yes, but\" suggests that the first woman is not a \"real\" Muslim because she is not following the stereotype of Muslim women as being oppressed and unable to eat with chopsticks.

The image pokes fun at this inconsistency by showing a shirt that says \"non-binary\" on it, but then has a caption that says \"yes, but\". It's like the shirt is saying \"yes, I'm non-binary, but only to a certain extent.\"",
    "20240101_180332_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows the unrealistic expectations of social media versus the reality. The first panel shows a beautiful, serene bathroom with a large window overlooking a mountain lake. The second panel shows a more realistic bathroom with a small window and a bathtub that is not as luxurious as the one in the first panel.

The image is a play on words, as \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cbut\u201d can be used to express two very different ideas. \u201cYes\u201d is often used to express agreement or acceptance, while \u201cbut\u201d is often used to express disagreement or objection.

It can clean your floors without you having to do anything. But in practice, it's not always so great.

The driver is not happy because their car is now dirty. This image shows that things are not always as they seem. What we see on the surface may not be the whole story.",

    "20240101_173800_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows the difference between how things are in theory and how they are in reality. In theory, having a FastPass should allow you to skip the line and get on the ride faster. However, in reality, the FastPass line is often just as long as the regular line. This is because there are always people who try to cheat the system by using multiple FastPasses or by sneaking into the line. As a result, the FastPass system often ends up being more of a hassle than it is worth.",

The first one is labeled \"Yes\" and the second one is labeled \"But.\" The \"Yes\" parking lot is full of cars, while the \"But\" parking lot is empty. The image is funny because it shows how people will often choose the more convenient option, even if it is not the best option. In this case, the \"Yes\" parking lot is more convenient because it is closer to the store. However, the \"But\" parking lot is actually a better option because it is less crowded and there is less of a chance of getting your car damaged.",

The image is satirical because it is making fun of the common phrase \"yes, but.\" This phrase is often used to express someone's agreement with something, but with a condition or reservation. The image is suggesting that the person being bitten by the snake is agreeing to something, but with a condition or reservation that they are not going to be able to fulfill. This is because the snake is biting their butt, which is a very painful and dangerous situation. The image is also funny because it is unexpected. The viewer is expecting the person being bitten by the snake",

The woman in the first panel is clearly afraid of getting vaccinated, but the woman in the second panel is getting a tattoo without any hesitation. This suggests that the anti-vaccination movement is based on fear and ignorance rather than on science.\n\nThe image is also funny because it shows the hypocrisy of some people who are against vaccination but are fine with other medical procedures that involve needles.

This is a satirical image because it is making fun of the fact that some people want to be muscular and fit but aren't willing to put in the work. The image is also",
    "20240101_180332_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it shows two very different perspectives on the same situation. \n\nOn the one hand, the woman in the bathtub appears to be enjoying a relaxing and luxurious bath with a beautiful view. The caption \"YES\" suggests that she is enjoying this experience. \n\nOn the other hand, the woman in the bathtub is shown sitting in a dark bathtub with a blank expression. The caption \"BUT\" suggests that she is not enjoying this experience as much as the woman in the first image.\n\nThis image is satirical because it highlights the contrast between the two women's experiences. The woman in",
    "20240101_180912_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows a map of the character's visited places but instead of country names, it shows the character in different vacation poses. It implies that in all of his travels he only took pictures of himself in different poses instead of taking pictures of the landmarks and attractions of the places he visited.",
    "20240101_175558_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because on the left side it says \"mayo vegan\" so one would assume the mayo is vegan but on the right side of the image, a person is shown pouring the mayo on steak which is not vegan.",
    "20240101_173007_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows two groups of people under umbrellas. The first group is sitting at a table, and the second group is standing in a circle around the first group. The people in the second group are all holding their umbrellas up, while the people in the first group are not. This suggests that the people in the second group are trying to protect themselves from the rain, while the people in the first group are not. However, the people in the first group are sitting at a table, which is under an umbrella. This means that they are already protected from the rain. The people in the second group are not",
    "20240101_174927_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows how people are often more concerned with their appearance than with the world around them. The woman in the image is so focused on her reflection in the mirror that she doesn't even notice the chair that is right in front of her. This is a satirical commentary on how people are often so self-absorbed that they don't pay attention to the things that are right in front of them.",
    "20240101_175353_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it shows a juxtaposition between two images. The first image is of a hotel room with a nice view of the ocean. The second image is of a tsunami wave made out of the same hotel building. The juxtaposition of these two images creates a humorous effect because it shows how quickly and drastically a situation can change. It is also satirical because it shows how some people will build in places that are prone to natural disasters and then be surprised when those disasters happen.",
    "20240101_175808_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it shows the contrast between what is considered beautiful on the inside and what is considered beautiful on the outside. The image on the left shows a woman who is naturally beautiful, with no makeup, and wearing a simple dress. The image on the right shows a woman who is wearing a lot of makeup and has her hair done, but her face is not as naturally beautiful as the woman on the left. The text in the image says \"Beauty is inside\", which is ironic because the woman on the right is not as naturally beautiful as the woman on the left, but she is wearing a lot",
    "20240101_174737_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows the struggle of work-life balance, and how it can feel like we are always 'on' and never have time for ourselves. The woman in the first panel is trying to work, but she is also trying to relax and have a coffee. The woman in the second panel is trying to work, but she is also trying to take care of her dog and her home. Both women are trying to do too much, and it is clear that they are both feeling stressed and overwhelmed.",
    "20240101_180332_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image shows two nearly identical pictures with the text \"YES\" over one and \"BUT\" over the other. The \"YES\" picture shows a bathtub with a beautiful view of mountains and a lake through a large window. The \"BUT\" picture shows the same bathtub, but with a woman sitting in it. The implication is that the woman is ruining the beautiful view.",
    "20240101_180509_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " It is funny because it is an illustration of a music studio and the sound waves of a voice saying \"yes, but\". \n\nThis can be interpreted in a few ways. On the one hand, it could be seen as a commentary on the way that people in the music industry are often quick to say yes to new projects, but are then slow to actually follow through. On the other hand, it could also be seen as a more general commentary on the way that people often say yes to things without really thinking about them through, and then later regret their decision.",
    "20240101_173800_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image shows a FastPass, which is a ticket that allows people to skip the line for a ride at a theme park. The text at the top of the image says \"Yes,\" which suggests that the FastPass is a good thing. However, the image also shows a long line of people waiting to use the FastPass. This suggests that the FastPass is not actually a very good thing, because it does not actually save people any time or make things easier.",
    "20240101_175953_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image shows a woman getting a vaccine, with an angelic figure looming over her. The implication is that the vaccine is going to turn her into a demon. This is a common theme in anti-vaccination propaganda, which often plays on fears about the safety of vaccines. The image is satirical because it takes this fear to an extreme, showing the woman literally transforming into a demon. This is meant to be humorous, but it also highlights the absurdity of the anti-vaccine argument.",
    "20240101_180037_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny and satirical because it shows two opposite reactions to a beautiful sunset. The first reaction is \"Yes,\" which captures the awe and wonder of the moment. The second reaction is \"But,\" which introduces a more practical and pessimistic perspective. It's a clever way to show how different people can have very different reactions to the same thing.",
    "20240101_180545_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows the hypocrisy of some people who claim to be vegan but still eat meat. The man in the image is proudly displaying his vegan t-shirt while eating a bowl of salad, but the woman in the image is disgusted by the thought of eating meat. This is a common stereotype of vegans, who are often seen as being hypocritical for not eating meat but still consuming other animal products, such as eggs and dairy.",
    "20240101_182426_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it shows the difference between how people organize their digital files and how they organize their physical files. The digital files are neatly organized, while the physical files are a complete mess. This highlights how people are more likely to put effort into organizing things that are not as important than things that are.",
    "20240101_182604_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows two words with opposite meanings next to each other. The word \"yes\" is next to a picture of a bathroom sink, and the word \"but\" is next to a picture of a door that says \"pull.\" This is funny because it's unexpected. The viewer is expecting to see the word \"no\" next to the picture of the bathroom sink, and the word \"push\" next to the picture of the door. The image is also satirical because it's making fun of the fact that people often say \"yes\" when they really mean \"no.\" For example, people might",

    "20240101_175326_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it uses a very detailed drawing of a snowy winter scene in the \u201cyes\u201d panel, and a much less detailed drawing of a snowy winter road in the \u201cbut\u201d panel. The humorous implication is that the artist does not want to put as much work into less appealing scenes.",
    "20240101_180159_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows a \"healthy cafe\" that has a \"smoking area\" with a big sign that depicts a cigarette. This is satirical because it shows how ridiculous it is to have a \"healthy\" cafe that allows smoking. The image suggests that the cafe is not as healthy as it claims to be, and that it is actually just a front for a smoking lounge.",
    "20240101_173024_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image shows the phrase \"yes\" and a man with tattoos on his arms. The word yes is tattooed on his arm, but the word \"but\" is not tattooed. This suggests that the man is not very good at making decisions. He is unable to make up his mind and therefore always has to add a \"but\" to his statements.",
    "20240101_173341_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows two people in a romantic, loving embrace. However, the 'BUT' image shows that the woman is actually very hot and uncomfortable, as indicated by the thermometer. This creates a humorous contrast between the romantic ideal and the messy reality of being in a relationship.",
    "20240101_180247_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows the contrast between how men and women are often portrayed in relation to household chores. The woman is shown doing all of the cooking, cleaning, and childcare, while the man is shown relaxing with a cat. This is a humorous and satirical commentary on the traditional gender roles that are often still prevalent in our society.",
    "20240101_173800_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny/satirical because it shows the \"Fastpass\" line is actually longer than the regular line.",
    "20240101_180626_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny and satirical because it shows a hand holding a remote control shaped like a TV. This symbolizes the fact that in the modern age, people are increasingly controlled by their televisions. The image is also satirical because it suggests that people are so addicted to television that they are willing to give up their own freedom in order to watch it.",
    "20240101_175353_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image shows a regular room with a door, window, and furniture. The door leads outside to a view of the ocean. The title of the image is \"Yes\". The second image shows the same room, but the ocean view outside is now a giant wave which is about to crash on the building. The title of the second image is \"Yes, but\". \n\nThe image is funny because it makes a play on words. The first image is positive and optimistic, while the second image is negative and pessimistic. The two images together create a humorous contrast.",
    "20240101_182531_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows a very slim phone with the text \"Ultra Slim\" on it. And then below that there is a much thicker phone with a power bank attached to it. This is poking fun at the fact that even though some phones are advertised as being very slim, in reality they often need to be used with a bulky power bank in order to last through the day.",
    "20240101_175738_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is satirical because the man is celebrating the growth of his company, while the graph behind him shows that the company is actually in decline. This is a common occurrence in the business world, where companies will often try to put a positive spin on their performance, even when the numbers don't support it. The image is also humorous because it shows how easily people can be fooled by appearances, and how important it is to be critical of the information that is presented to us.",
    "20240101_175808_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it plays on the common phrase \"beauty is on the inside.\" The image shows a woman looking in a mirror, applying make-up, with the words \"beauty is inside\" written next to her. The woman is depicted with a plain face, and the make-up she is applying is not very flattering. The image suggests that the woman is trying to achieve beauty on the outside, but that she is not very successful. This is in contrast to the phrase \"beauty is on the inside,\" which suggests that beauty is not about physical appearance, but rather about inner qualities such as kindness",
    "20240101_174000_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows the difference between how people imagine their ideal bedroom and how it actually looks. The ideal bedroom is depicted as being large, luxurious, and stylish, while the real bedroom is shown as being small, cluttered, and messy. This is a common source of humor, as people often have unrealistic expectations about what their lives should be like. The image is satirical because it makes fun of the unrealistic expectations that people have about their bedrooms. It is a reminder that life is not always perfect and that we should be grateful for what we have.",

    "20240101_182506_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it shows a model wearing white pants with black paint splashed on the bottom half of the legs. The word \"Yes\" is written above the picture, suggesting that the model is happy with the way she looks, despite having black paint on her pants. The word \"But\" is written below the picture, suggesting that the model is actually not happy with the way she looks, despite saying \"yes\" above. The image is satirical because it shows how models are often expected to conform to a certain image, even if it means sacrificing their own personal style or comfort.",
    "20240101_182638_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it shows the hypocrisy of people who claim to care about animal welfare but still eat meat. The image shows a chicken labeled \"Happy Chicken,\" implying that the chicken was raised in a humane environment. However, the chicken is still dead and packaged for consumption, showing that the label is a lie and that the chicken was not actually happy. This image satirizes the way that people often claim to care about animal welfare but still continue to support the factory farming industry, which is known for its inhumane treatment of animals.",
    "20240101_173043_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows two common diet foods, but labels them as \"YES\" and \"BUT\".
