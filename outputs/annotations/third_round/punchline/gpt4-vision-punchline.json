On the right, the contrasting \"BUT\" panel depicts a person nonchalantly sipping coffee while a mushroom cloud from a nuclear explosion is visible outside the window, which humorously highlights a dire situation being ignored or taken with surprising calmness. The punchline of this meme often plays on the discrepancy between an expected, calm situation versus an outrageous or alarming background event, implying an ironic or inexplicable disregard for the seriousness of the situation.",

On the right, the word \"BUT\" is seen, and the corresponding picture humorously depicts a bed with a human-shaped indentation in the middle, implying that the person has simply covered the unmade bed with a blanket without properly making it.

On the left panel, there is a group of individuals holding up trophies, with the word \"YES,\" indicating a sense of achievement or agreement. On the right panel, there is a drawing of a man with a somewhat unimpressed or unconvinced expression, accompanied by the word \"BUT.\" The meme plays on the juxtaposition of an affirmative or positive sentiment with a contrasting, skeptical, or hesitant response, suggesting that there is a caveat or exception to the initial positive statement.

It's the irony of the situation that is meant to be funny, as the reality (a crowded beach) doesn't match the expectation (a secluded and secret location).",

On the right, the image shows a large burger and fries with the word \"BUT,\" suggesting a contradiction or exception to the diet, as these foods are typically not considered diet-friendly.

The joke here is a play on words: when read together, it phonetically sounds like \"yes, but,\" which is a common phrase one might use to agree with a statement but then introduce a contrasting opinion.

However, the bottom part humorously undermines this by showing an actual login form with the fields labeled \"Sername\" and \"ASSword\", and the user is about to click \"Forgot password?\" This implies that despite having a strong password, it's so complex or difficult to remember that the user needs to reset it, highlighting",

The humor in this meme is derived from a play on words, where \"YES\" is visually paired with an object that \"ties up\" or concludes something (the rope), while \"BUT\" is followed by an image of a cat that literally \"scratches\" at the surface, symbolically indicating objection or complication.

The \"BUT\" panel shows an impossibly long and straight road with many obstacles, represented by deep potholes. The punchline is not conveyed through text but rather through the visual absurdity of the images.

The word \"But,\" is humorously linked with an image of a person on a speedboat, where the word \"but\" is a homophone for \"butt,\" which is seated in the boat as they ride across the water.

However, on the right side, the punchline is visualized by showing the eco-bag being used to carry plastic bottles, which are often associated with environmental pollution and not being eco-friendly. The humor arises from the inconsistency between the eco-friendly intention suggested by the bag and the less eco-friendly action of carrying plastic bottles.

    "20240101_174000_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The meme presents a humorous juxtaposition with the word \"YES,\" followed by a sleek and well-made bed, implying a standard or expectation of neatness and order. Next to it, the word \"BUT\" introduces a contrasting image of the same bed in a disheveled and messy state, showing someone sleeping in a very relaxed and untidy manner. The punchline of the meme is the contrast between the idealized presentation of the bed and the relatable reality of how it's often used in everyday life, highlighting the humorous discrepancy between expectations and actual behavior.",
    "20240101_180319_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": "The meme you've provided shows a play on the duality of a visual representation that can be interpreted in two different ways. On the first panel, it simply presents a vase with flowers under the word \"YES,\" suggesting a positive or agreeable situation. On the second panel, the same image is manipulated to include a cross on what could be perceived as a gravestone, under the word \"BUT,\" indicating a caveat or a less favorable condition. The punchline is in the realization that while the first image seemed purely positive, the second one adds a twist that changes the context to something potentially negative or complicated, despite using the same",
    "20240101_182506_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": "The meme consists of two panels with the words \"YES,\" above the first panel and \"BUT\" above the second panel. The first panel shows a pair of legs wearing trousers that are somewhat flared at the bottom, standing on a dry surface. The second panel shows another pair of legs wearing trousers, but these are implausibly twisted and merged with a liquid puddle beneath them, creating a surreal and impossible image. The punchline here is a play on expectations\u2014the first image presents a normal situation followed by the word \"BUT,\" which indicates a contrast, that is humorously and visually represented by the second, bizarre image",
    "20240101_182638_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The meme shows a play on the word \"chicken\" with two contrasting images. The first part says \"YES, CHICKEN\" with a stylized depiction of a happy chicken, implying a positive or wholesome aspect of chicken. The second part says \"BUT\" and shows the same chicken in cartoon form, but this time it's humorously placed within slices of deli meat, which are typically made from chicken, hence the \"BUT\" as a twist showing an ironic or dark humor take on the initial positive image. The punchline lies in the juxtaposition of the chicken's happiness with its fate as food, presented",
    "20240101_173043_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": "The image is a two-panel meme that plays on the visual similarity between the word \"Diet\" and objects that are commonly not associated with a diet. On the left panel, it shows a \"Diet Cola\" can with a standard-sized portion of fries which might be considered a typical diet-friendly alternative due to the diet soda. On the right panel, however, the word \"Diet\" is humorously misconstrued as part of the structure of an exaggeratedly large burger and an enormous portion of fries, suggesting a comically large meal that contradicts typical dietary choices. The punchline is the contrast between the expectation of",
    "20240101_173332_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The punchline of this meme is in the contrast between the left and right images. On the left, we see a phone with a notification for a group chat that includes 28 people, which might generally suggest active participation or social engagement. The right image shows a finger pressing the 'mute' or 'silence' notification bell, implying that while the person acknowledges being part of a group chat, they prefer to mute the notifications, likely due to the number of messages or interruptions they can generate. The \"YES, BUT\" template is commonly used to express a nuanced agreement or a condition that comes with a seemingly positive statement."
