The left panel shows a strictly enforced no-cap policy for a lone individual, while the right panel humorously contrasts this with a group blatantly disregarding the rule without consequence, highlighting the arbitrary or selective nature of rule enforcement. It plays on the \"rules for thee but not for me\" motif, pointing out hypocrisy or illogical exceptions in a playful manner.",
    "20240101_173826.jpg": "The image is humorous because it shows an exaggerated contrast between two individuals' expertise levels across various disciplines, with one having significantly more experience and knowledge in each area. The satirical point lies in suggesting that sometimes people with lesser expertise might present themselves as equally or more knowledgeable, often leading to comical or ironic situations.",
    "20240101_180407.jpg": "The image plays on the dual meaning of the word \"but(t).\" The first panel shows a person confidently starting a statement with \"YES,\" suggesting they're about to make a point. The next panel reveals a comedic twist with visuals of dog butts, punning on the expected \"BUT\" argument rebuttal with literal animal behinds, creating a visual pun and subverting the expected serious or argumentative follow-up.",
    "20240101_174021.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on the concept of sustainability. The first panel shows a reusable bottle with the recycling symbol, suggesting eco-friendliness. The second panel humorously undermines this by showing the bottle being filled with plastic, indicating a contradictory action to the supposed environmental commitment, thus, highlighting the irony of sometimes superficial environmental efforts.",
    "20240101_173419.jpg": "The image is humorous because it highlights a common modern experience: reality often seems less impressive when captured on a smartphone camera. The left panel shows a large, beautiful moon as seen by the naked eye, while the right panel shows the same scene through a phone camera, where the moon appears disappointingly small and less impactful. The contrast pokes fun at the limitations of technology in conveying true scale and beauty.",
    "20240101_172932.jpg": "The image humorously depicts the difference between the intended use of a product and common user behavior. While the left panel shows empty hangers implying that clothes should be hung on them (\"YES\"), the right panel displays clothes piled on a chair (\"BUT\"), which is a relatable depiction of how many people actually store their clothes in daily life, neglecting the hangers.",
    "20240101_173123.jpg": "This image plays on the common frustration of attending an event with assigned seating, only to find that your seat is directly behind a pole or obstruction, blocking the view. It humorously exaggerates the issue by showing an entire audience perfectly aligned except for one obstructed seat, suggesting a comically unfortunate luck that the ticket holder has the only bad seat in the house.",
    "20240101_175953.jpg": "The image seems to satirize the contradictory or conflicting attitudes towards health and safety. In the first panel, a person hesitates to get a vaccine shot, implying caution or skepticism. In contrast, the second panel shows the same person nonchalantly smoking, which is widely known to be harmful. The humor arises from the visual play on the word \"shot,\" with the vaccine needle and the smoking gun, aligned with the text \"YES, BUT,\" hinting at rationalizing one health risk while fearing another less risky action.",
    "20240101_182526.jpg": "This image is humorous due to the contrast between the implied conservatism and piety suggested by the tattoo of a cross on a person's neck in the first panel, and the unexpected reveal in the second panel where the same person is engaging in pole dancing, an activity often associated with less conservative lifestyles. The humor comes from the juxtaposition of opposing expectations and the surprise element.",
    "20240101_173813.jpg": "The image humorously comments on how people often do not use ergonomic chairs as intended. On the left, it says \"YES,\" showing the chair's correct posture-supporting design. On the right, the word \"BUT\" indicates a common reality where the person slouches, negating the chair\u2019s ergonomic benefits. The joke lies in the contrast between ideal use and actual user behavior.",
    "20240101_172951.jpg": "This image plays on the disparity between a customer's request at a barber shop and the outcome of the haircut. The customer presumably asks for something they've seen that looks trendy or stylish (implied by the attentive barber and the customer's hopeful glance at a photo), but the second panel reveals a comically unflattering and outdated bowl haircut, contrasting expectations with a humorous reality.",
    "20240101_181310.jpg": "This image is humorous because it depicts a Twitter user with the handle \"Yes, But\" who is ironically blocked by another user with a similar name \"YesBut__.\" The situation is a playful take on how people with similar views (implied by the similar usernames) can still find themselves at odds on social media platforms, to the point of blocking each other.",
    "20240101_182249.jpg": "The image is humorous because it portrays the irony of spending a large amount of money on an expensive pen, only to use it for signing insignificant documents, likely of less value than the pen itself. It satirizes the contrast between the high cost of luxury items and the mundane, everyday actions they are used for.",
    "20240101_180626.jpg": "The image satirizes the complexity and abundance of remote controls for various electronic devices in a typical home entertainment setup. It humorously points out that despite advancements in technology, we often still need to juggle multiple remotes for simple tasks, leading to confusion and inconvenience, hence the unenthusiastic \"Yes, But\" caption.",
    "20240101_174025.jpg": "The image juxtaposes the romantic sentiment typically associated with the phrase \"wish you were here\" with an unexpected and humorous setting\u2014a person using the toilet. The contrast between the private nature of the bathroom setting and the typically intimate or scenic locations one might associate with such a message creates the humor in this illustration.",
    "20240101_175859.jpg": "This image is satirical because it contrasts the self-care act of brushing teeth in the left panel labeled \"YES,\" suggesting something positive, with the right panel labeled \"BUT,\" where the same woman blows a bubble that bursts on an unsuspecting man's face. The humor arises from the unexpected and slightly absurd sequence of events and the incongruity between personal hygiene and the intrusive prank.",
    "20240101_174107.jpg": "The image is humorous because it illustrates a contradictory behavior. The person agrees with the statement \"YES,\" which suggests acceptance or readiness, only to follow it with a \"BUT\" that contradicts the first panel's implication of agreement. He's ostensibly trying to clean his windshield but ends up spraying the water in the wrong direction, which is an obvious and comical mistake. The humor lies in the gap between intention and outcome.",
    "20240101_182545.jpg": "The image humorously portrays a common marketing strategy, \"Buy 2 Get 1 Free,\" highlighting how the offer isn't always as favorable as it seems.

    "20240101_181316.jpg": "This image humorously contrasts the expectation versus reality of cat behavior. On the left side is a complex, multi-tiered cat tree labeled \"YES,\" implying the intention of providing an elaborate play and resting area for a cat.

    "20240101_182541.jpg": "The image plays on the common idiom \"pat yourself on the back,\" used when someone is giving themselves credit for an achievement. In a literal and humorous twist, the second panel shows a person with an extra hand to actually pat their back, suggesting they perhaps give themselves too much credit or are self-congratulatory to a humorous extent.",
    "20240101_173955.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays with expectations. In the first panel, the person appears to be wearing a swim cap, suggesting they\u2019re prepared for swimming. However, the second panel reveals they're actually wearing a beanie, which is out of place for swimming, creating an amusing surprise and highlighting the incongruity between the swim setting and the winter attire.",
    "20240101_175009.jpg": "This image is humorous due to the common graphic design issue it highlights, where an object (a hat in this case) that seems correctly isolated with a transparent background does not fit seamlessly when placed onto another image or background, often due to scaling or positioning errors. The rational expectation is that the hat should fit the character's head, but instead, it awkwardly floats above, creating a visual gag.",
    "Screenshot_2024-01-01-17-59-17-340_com.twitter.android-edit.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the common situation where exercise equipment, purchased with good intentions, often ends up being used as an impromptu clothes rack rather than for its intended fitness purpose. The contrast between the \"Yes\" (suggesting the ideal use of the equipment) and the \"But\" (showing the reality) highlights the discrepancy between our aspirations and our actual behavior.",
    "20240101_182552.jpg": "The image is humorous because it presents a contrast between expectations and reality. The hand pouring dog food is labeled \"Compliments,\" and the dog eating the food is labeled \"Artist.\" The satire lies in suggesting that artists receive compliments instead of tangible rewards or compensation for their work, likening compliments to cheap sustenance that is not entirely fulfilling or reflective of their true needs.",
    "20240101_180155.jpg": "The image is a humorous take on the biblical saying \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to gain eternal life.\" The left side shows a camel and a needle's eye, while the right side depicts a 'rich man,' presumably, trying to fit a smaller camel through a needle in a playful, literal interpretation of the metaphor, which is originally intended to discuss the difficulty of the wealthy achieving spiritual fulfillment.",
    "20240101_174123.jpg": "This comic juxtaposes complex theoretical knowledge with real-world application. On the left, an individual confidently explains complicated mathematical graphs and equations, showing academic prowess.

    "20240101_180403.jpg": "The image is a play on the phrase \"Yes, but\" by visually representing it with a water cooler and a cup. The \"Yes\" part shows a water cooler full of water, signaling affirmation or availability, while the \"but\" part shows an empty water dispenser, indicating a contradiction or problem. It's humorous because it uses a literal interpretation of a figurative expression to create an unexpected visual pun.",
    "20240101_173317.jpg": "This image is satirical because it plays with the expectation of swatting a small bug on one's neck. In the first panel, we anticipate a minor action with possibly a small smear, but the second panel humorously exaggerates the result to an extreme, showing an unexpectedly large and messy splatter on the shirt, which is an over-the-top outcome from such a simple act.",
    "20240101_172731.jpg": "The image is humorous and satirical because it plays on the name \"Caesar\" salad, juxtaposing it with what appears to be a \"seizure\" salad in the second panel. In the first panel, it shows a typical Caesar salad; the second pane distorts this by showing the salad components violently shaking, a play on words suggesting the salad is having a seizure.",
    "20240101_174708.jpg": "The image plays on the phrase \"Yes, but\" as a literal visual pun. On the left, \"Yes\" shows an intact picnic with cheese, bread, and wine, creating an idyllic scene. On the right, \"But\" shows the same scene with the bread and cheese shaped like a human rear end. The humor arises from the unexpected transformation and the play on words\u2014where \"but\" is a homophone for \"butt,\" reflecting the visual joke.",
    "20240101_175331.jpg": "The image humorously depicts a dog-walking scenario captioned with \"YES, BUT\". On the left, a person says \"YES\" while walking a single dog, and on the right, they say \"BUT\" when the scenario turns chaotic with multiple dogs entangling their leashes. It plays on the idea that while agreeing to a simple request can be easy, complications often arise that weren't initially considered, leading to a more complex and humorous situation.",
    "20240101_172350.jpg": "The image depicts a popular meme format where an initially positive statement (\"YES\") is humorously contradicted by the following panel (\"BUT\"). Here, it shows a bowl of soup in the first panel, suggesting something good, but the second panel reveals a teabag being used, implying the soup is being treated like tea, which is a comical and nonsensical twist. This absurdity is what generates the humor in the image.",
    "20240101_182503.jpg": "The image is a humorous take on expectations versus reality. The left side showcases a serene underwater scene with colorful fish, implying an idealized view, captioned \"YES.\" The right side, captioned \"BUT,\" reveals the above perspective of a clumsy human snorkeler, feet up and flailing, disrupting the idyllic scene below, providing a comedic contrast to the initial expectation.",
    "20240101_181006.jpg": "This image is humorous because it portrays an all-too-familiar and frustrating scenario. On the left, a 'YES' signifies the ideal function of a screen window\u2014to keep bugs out. However, the 'BUT' on the right side comically reveals the reality that despite the screen, a persistent mosquito has managed to get through and is aggravating someone. The humor lies in the subverted expectation and the common annoyance of insect invasions indoors.",
    "20240101_173254.jpg": "This image humorously critiques the deceptive packaging of products, particularly fruit. The left side shows a container of strawberries looking perfectly ripe from the top view, while the right side reveals the bottom layer is of poor quality.

    "20240101_175738.jpg": "This image is a humorous take on the optimism bias that can occur in financial or business settings. The character acknowledges a positive trend on the left, using \"YES,\" but then counters with \"BUT\" to address the subsequent decline on the right. The contrast between short-term success and long-term downturn plays on the selective emphasis individuals or organizations might place on positive data while downplaying negative trends.",
    "20240101_181457.jpg": "The image is comically pointing out the human tendency to agree in principle but hesitate in practice. In the first panel, one person stands confidently alone, perhaps signifying agreement or a decision made. In the second panel, the entrance of a crowd causes the individual to hesitate and reconsider, exemplifying the influence of group dynamics or peer pressure on personal conviction.",
    "20240101_173433.jpg": "This image plays on the common phrase \"Yes, but,\" which is often used to agree with a statement before presenting a contradiction or exception. The humor arises from the literal interpretation of this phrase, featuring a car's side-view mirror with \"Yes,\" and the rear-view mirror with \"But,\" instead of showing actual mirror reflections. This satirical twist implies a comical indecision or contradiction in the context of driving decisions.",
    "20240101_173700.jpg": "The humor in this image comes from the contrast between the common assertion \"Yes, but\" and the action depicted. One hand enthusiastically accepts a slice of pizza, implying agreement or a positive response. However, the other hand hesitantly holds a hotdog sideways, as if using it as a writing utensil, representing a conflicting, impractical, or paradoxical condition, hence the \"but.\" It plays on the absurdity of using a hotdog in a way that defies its usual purpose, creating a visual pun.",
    "20240101_173542.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the irony between the concept of a \"Secret Beach\" and its obvious popularity. The first panel suggests an exclusive, hidden location with the label \"Secret Beach,\" while the second reveals the reality: a crowded beach, contradicting the notion of secrecy and exclusivity. The \"YES, BUT\" framing enhances the joke by juxtaposing expectation versus reality.",
    "20240101_175326.jpg": "The image contrasts an idealistic snowy scene with a messy, slushy aftermath that is often overlooked. The humor lies in the juxtaposition of the expectation of a perfect winter wonderland (\"YES\") against the less appealing reality of melting snow and muddy conditions (\"BUT\"). It satirizes how experiences can be romanticized, only to confront a less desirable truth.",
    "20240101_172354.jpg": "This image is humorous because it portrays a contradictory situation.

    "20240101_173332.jpg": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition of the intention to join a group chat, depicted by the \"Join\" button, against the impulsive or more common desire to silence notifications by tapping the \"Mute\" icon.

    "20240101_173245.jpg": "The image plays on the often used phrase \"dreams come true\" presented in a whimsical, inspirational style on a notebook's cover. However, the punchline lies in the literal \"but\" which, when the notebook is opened, reveals money, suggesting that while dreams are nice, financial means are often necessary to achieve them, poking fun at idealistic sayings by grounding them in practical reality.",
    "20240101_181251.jpg": "The image humorously contrasts the excitement of playing a favorite song in a car with the reality of not being able to fully enjoy it because of the need to stay alert while driving. The first panel shows a hand pressing the \"favorite song\" button eagerly, while the second panel shows only a cautious eye visible in the rearview mirror, suggesting that the driver's attention is divided between the music and the road.",
    "20240101_173007.jpg": "The image plays on the \"Yes, but\" meme format, where two contrasting perspectives are presented. It humorously depicts two patio sets, one perfectly arranged, the other chaotically tangled\u2014which is visually unexpected. The contradiction between the orderly \"Yes\" and the disorderly \"But\" implies a comical acceptance of both the ideal and the less-than-ideal reality.",
    "20240101_175602.jpg": "This image is humorous because it contrasts the simplicity of using a single vegetable peeler labeled \"YES,\" with a complex, overly-complicated contraption of multiple peelers attached to glove fingers labeled \"BUT.\" It satirizes how sometimes people or companies overengineer solutions to problems that have simple answers, thereby adding unnecessary complexity to a task that is easily accomplished with more straightforward tools.",
    "20240101_182519.jpg": "The image is satirical because it contrasts the proclaimed support for free speech with the hypocritical action of blocking a large number of people. On one side, the person expresses a strong stance for free speech, but the other side reveals that they don't tolerate dissenting opinions, thereby undermining the very principle they advocate.",
    "20240101_175023.jpg": "The image is humorous because it highlights the irony of buying premium mineral water, only to fill an ice tray with tap water, effectively mixing them when the ice melts in a glass. It satirizes consumer behavior where individuals may pay for high-quality products but then contradictorily use a lesser-quality item, which undermines the initial premium choice.",
    "20240101_174237.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on a familiar pedestrian traffic light sequence (\"Yes\" for walk; \"But\" for don't walk), but the \"But\" panel humorously depicts a giant pedestrian about to cross a cityscape, subverting expectations. This exaggeration amplifies the literal interpretation of the \"don't walk\" signal, suggesting an absurd reason why pedestrians should wait.",
    "20240101_181343.jpg": "The image is humorous because it juxtaposes two contrasting scenarios involving the same group of people. On the left, they appear confident and stylish, but on the right, in a swimming pool where they're presumably without their clothes or hair styling, they reveal insecurities like baldness and body shapes, suggesting that appearances can be deceptive and that everyone has vulnerabilities.",
    "20240101_180345.jpg": "The image humorously juxtaposes the idea of committed cycling with a twist ending. Initially, it seems one panel will celebrate a healthy bike ride, but the second panel reveals the bicycle was actually transported by car, implying little actual exercise. This satirical twist mocks the sometimes superficial commitment to fitness and sustainability, playing on the expectation that people who show bikes endorse active lifestyles, only to subvert it with a lazy reality.",
    "20240101_173752.jpg": "The image is humorous because it depicts a common frustrating scenario where a dual electrical outlet is rendered partly unusable due to the bulky design of a plug or power adapter. The word \"YES\" suggests a positive possibility of using both sockets, but the \"BUT\" followed by the obstructive plug design comically highlights the irony and the frequent design oversight in electronic accessories that don't consider the proximity of other outlets.",
    "20240101_172414.jpg": "This image humorously contrasts the heavily layered and bundled upper body against the barely protected lower body in winter attire. The left panel reads \"YES,\" showing the person fully geared up in a puffy jacket to combat the cold.

    "20240101_172412.jpg": "The image is satirical because it comments on the paradox of individuals who may fervently support abortion rights (\"YES\") but are not as enthusiastic or supportive when it comes to taking responsibility for child care responsibilities (\"BUT\"), as depicted by the person hastily leaving the scene to avoid taking care of the baby. It plays on the contrast between advocating for a choice and participating in the consequences of that choice.",
    "20240101_180851.jpg": "The image humorously contrasts an idyllic picnic scenario labeled \"YES\" with a far less appealing version labeled \"BUT.\" The left side depicts a perfect, sunny day, while the right shows the same picnic plagued by ants, a common nuisance.

    "20240101_173748.jpg": "The image juxtaposes two types of calendars, a regular one and a \"menstrual calendar,\" with a humorous undertone.

    "20240101_181422.jpg": "The image plays on the expectation versus reality theme. It humorously contrasts the idealized notion of remote work\u2014relaxing by the beach, often romanticized in marketing and social media\u2014with the frustrating reality of technical issues, such as a slow or failing software update. The dichotomy highlights the often overlooked challenges of working remotely, like unreliable technology, which can disrupt the dream of a seamless, idyllic work environment.",
    "20240101_175208.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the phrase \"Yes, but\"\u2014a common expression used to agree with a statement before presenting a counterargument or additional condition. Here, instead of a verbal follow-up, it humorously depicts an ice cream cone with the ice cream scooped hanging precariously, suggesting that while one may indeed have an ice cream cone, the situation is not entirely positive\u2014the treat is at risk of being lost, analogous to the nuances often accompanying the phrase in conversation.",
    "20240101_180807.jpg": "This image is humorous because it showcases an ironic situation at a print and copy shop\u2014a place that should epitomize efficiency and functionality in printing. The ticket machine, intended to organize customer service, has ironically printed a barely legible ticket number. The satire lies in the print shop's failure at its most basic task: to print clearly.",
    "20240101_175119.jpg": "The image is satirical because it highlights how some music bands label their tours as a \"world tour\" but only visit a limited number of countries, typically within specific regions, which hardly encompasses the entire world. The map emphasizes the irony by showing only a few countries colored in, suggesting these are the only stops on the \"world tour.\"",

    "20240101_180912.jpg": "This image plays on the common social media trend where individuals showcase the places they've visited. The humor lies in the contradiction: while the first panel suggests a well-traveled person, the second panel reveals that the visits were virtual, through computer screens, poking fun at the difference between real-life experiences and online representations. It satirizes how some people project an adventurous online persona without actually leaving home.",
    "20240101_174518.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the difference between expectations and reality.

However, the second panel humorously subverts this by showing him actually agreeing to ride an elephant, an unusual and comedic twist on the anticipated conversation.",
    "20240101_175558.jpg": "The humor in this image comes from the juxtaposition of a vegan product (vegan mayonnaise) with a decidedly non-vegan item (steak). It satirizes how sometimes individuals might prioritize one aspect of their diet, like avoiding animal products in condiments, while overlooking it in other areas. The \"Yes, but\" caption adds to the irony, suggesting a level of cognitive dissonance or selective adherence to vegan principles.",
    "20240101_181001.jpg": "The image presents a humorous take on the phrase \"Yes, but\" through a visual pun.

    "20240101_180952.jpg": "This image is humorous because it presents a contradiction where someone uses an umbrella to stay dry in the rain, yet the second panel shows the person pouring water from a soaked sock into their shoe, essentially undoing their efforts to stay dry.

The left panel depicts someone holding a salad with \"VEGAN\" written on their shirt, proudly signifying their choice. The right panel satirizes the perceived inclination of some vegans to interrupt or interject their lifestyle into conversations, with the butt interrupting mid-sentence, insinuating a disruption or non-sequitur addition to a discussion.",

One side shows a soccer player celebrating a goal with a shirt that says \"GOD IS GREAT,\" implying a moment of triumph and gratitude.

The expectation of a refreshing beverage is depicted in the first panel labeled \"YES,\" showing a drink with a reasonable amount of ice. The second panel, \"BUT,\" satirically reveals the reality, which often includes an excessive amount of ice leaving little room for the actual drink, thus highlighting a typical discrepancy between expectation and reality in a humorous way.",
    "20240101_173308.jpg": "The image is humorous because it contrasts the effort someone puts into skincare, depicted by a range of products on the left, with poor sleep habits shown on the right. The message is satirical as it suggests that despite using many skincare products to improve skin health, neglecting basic needs like adequate sleep, indicated by the alarm clock and empty coffee cups, can undermine those efforts.",
    "20240101_180455.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on a situation where someone reluctantly agrees with a statement (depicted by the word \"YES\"), but then immediately counteracts it with a \"BUT,\" hinting at a contradiction. In this case, the first panel suggests a formal dining experience with a waiter serving, but the second panel humorously subverts this by showing a casual, perhaps stingy scenario where a diner uses a dishwashing liquid bottle to dress their food, undermining the expected restaurant etiquette.",
    "20240101_174757.jpg": "The image is satirical because it juxtaposes a person's calm, everyday activity\u2014sitting in a caf\u00e9\u2014with a drastic and alarming event happening outside, which is a nuclear explosion. The humor lies in the contrast between the person's nonchalant \"Yes, but\" attitude and the catastrophic nature of the situation, implying a comical level of denial or an extreme example of being unfazed.",
    "20240101_174753.jpg": "This image is humorous and satirical because it contrasts an idealistic, serene coffee shop scene labeled \"YES,\" with the harsh, less-glamorous reality outside labeled \"BUT.\" A person enjoys the comfort inside, oblivious to the chaotic scene outside featuring dogs scavenging in a rundown environment. It pokes fun at how we often choose to focus on the pleasant aspects of life, ignoring the less appealing truths just beyond our immediate view.",
    "20240101_173401.jpg": "The image is humorous because it portrays a common social situation where someone gives the impression of being self-satisfied or self-loving (as shown by the person hugging themselves), but the second panel reveals a twist: the self-embrace was actually motivated by a need to scratch an itch on the back. This satirical take plays on the discrepancy between perceived intentions and actual, more mundane motivations.",
    "20240101_180312.jpg": "The image humorously highlights a social media situation where a person has a relatively low number of followers (1053) but follows a significantly higher number of accounts (5467). The joke lies in the implicit suggestion that someone is trying to assert their popularity or social media influence with the word \"YES,\" but the large number of people they follow (often seen as an attempt to gain followers through 'follow-backs') contradicts that implication, as pointed out by the \"BUT.\"",
    "20240101_172315.jpg": "The image humorously contrasts expectations with reality by showing an idealized situation labeled \"YES,\" where a person is elegantly wearing high heels, with a less glamorous \"BUT\" scenario, where the person has removed the heels due to discomfort, revealing tired and cramped feet. It plays on the common experience of high heels being stylish but often painful to wear for extended periods.",
    "20240101_174548.jpg": "This image is humorous because it contrasts the reckless abandon of crashing through a glass door in the first panel with the precise adherence to COVID-19 safety in the second, where the person insists on pressing the elevator button with a disinfectant wipe. It's satirical as it reflects the inconsistency of people taking extreme measures in some aspects of life while being careless in others.",
    "20240101_172924.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on the phrase \"yes, but\" using visual puns. The left side shows a cup with what appears to be a bear design, hinting at the word \"yes,\" which phonetically resembles \"yeS\" with the \"S\" echoing the \"bear\" sound. The right side shows a person whispering into someone's butt\u2014literally visualizing the word \"but.\" The juxtaposition creates a silly and unexpected interpretation of the common phrase.",
    "20240101_173135.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the phrase \"Yes, but\"\u2014commonly used to agree with someone before adding a contradictory statement. Instead of a verbal exchange, it humorously illustrates a literal \"but\"\u2014a person is about to plug in a cord \"yes,\" but another hand intervenes to prevent it, creating a visual pun on the phrase.",
    "20240101_174654.jpg": "The humor in this image stems from the juxtaposition of medieval grandeur with a mundane modern element\u2014a public toilet (WC). The left panel shows a proud king in front of his castle, invoking feelings of nobility and power, but the right panel humorously undercuts this by showing a privy built into the castle wall, which is a contrastingly unglamorous aspect of medieval life. The words \"YES, BUT\" suggest that while castles and kingship have their impressive sides, they also had their less-than-luxurious realities.",
    "20240101_173024.jpg": "This image plays on the trope of people agreeing in principle with a statement or idea (\"Yes\") but then adding exceptions, conditions, or making excuses (\"But\"), which undermines the initial agreement. The humor is visualized through a literal depiction of someone with an arm extended, ready to interject with a \"but,\" suggesting that they are often contradictory or argumentative.",
    "20240101_174927.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the common tendency to follow a statement of agreement or acknowledgement with an exception or contradiction, often signified by \"Yes, but.\" It contrasts a simple, uncontested concept\u2014a chair (which no one would typically dispute)\u2014with a more complex situation where a woman appears to take a selfie, accentuating her curves, suggesting that the reality might be different from the image, hence the \"but.\" It's a satire on how social media often portrays an edited version of reality.",
    "20240101_173104.jpg": "This image humorously contrasts a person's initial positive response, \"YES,\" with a less committed, hesitant, or contradictory reaction, \"BUT,\" using the scenario of eating a meal. Despite appearing ready to enjoy her food without distractions, the second panel reveals her compulsion to check her phone, underscoring the modern challenge of disconnecting from technology to be fully present in everyday activities.",
    "20240101_182328.jpg": "The image is humorous because it contrasts the intent to be eco-friendly with the reality of plastic consumption. On the left, a person proudly displays an \"eco bag,\" suggesting environmental consciousness. On the right, however, the same bag is filled with numerous plastic items, undermining the eco-friendly statement with actions that contribute to plastic waste, highlighting a common inconsistency between beliefs and behaviors.",
    "20240101_172325.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the duality of perspective. The first frame presents a tree covered in blossoms, implying it\u2019s beautiful and flourishing. However, the second frame, while labeled \"BUT\", shows a solitary bird shivering on a bare branch, implying a less idyllic scene\u2014perhaps it's cold or the tree is not as lively. This contrast highlights the subjectivity of experiences, conveying that there's often another side to what initially appears positive or negative.",
    "20240101_172913.jpg": "The humor in this image stems from the expectation vs. reality trope commonly used in satirical content. A person might think their Halloween costume is unique, but upon arriving at the party, they're met with the comical disappointment of seeing several others wearing the exact same outfit, undermining their attempt at individuality.",
    "20240101_175531.jpg": "The image is humorous because it illustrates a common frustration with using tissue boxes. The first panel shows a single tissue being pulled out, as intended. However, the second panel humorously exaggerates the reality that often multiple tissues come out at once, despite only needing one, which is a relatable and slightly annoying experience for many people.",
    "20240101_174029.jpg": "The image is humorous due to the play on words and visual pun. The left panel shows a person using slices of cucumber as makeshift glasses, leading to the expectation of the word \"but\" being followed by a contrasting statement. However, the right panel playfully subverts this by showing the back of an actual \"butt\" of a rabbit, tying into the shape of the round rabbit tail and the round cucumber slices, creating a literal visual interpretation of \"but\" as \"butt.\"",
    "20240101_173411.jpg": "This image humorously plays on the expectation-vs-reality trope. The left panel, labeled \"YES,\" depicts a person with a full ponytail, suggesting confidence or an ideal scenario. The right panel, labeled \"BUT,\" shows the same person, but with a significantly thinner and patchier ponytail, implying a less ideal or disappointing reality. This contrast can resonate with experiences of anticipating something positively but facing a more modest or underwhelming outcome.",
    "20240101_180501.jpg": "The image humorously plays on the concept of having a switch for body features. In the left panel labeled \"YES,\" a man has a visibly toned abdomen, akin to having the \"abs feature\" turned \"OFF.\" Conversely, the right panel, labeled \"BUT,\" shows the man with a flat stomach as if the \"abs feature\" is now turned \"ON,\" implying a preference for the toned look. This satirical reversal of expectations mocks the idea of effortlessly switching physical traits.",
    "20240101_182511.jpg": "The humorous contrast in the image comes from the colorful and unconventional hairstyle in a somber setting\u2014the funeral. The meme template \"Yes, But\" typically highlights an unfitting or absurd aspect in a serious context, and here it suggests that someone maintained their quirky style even in death, offering a playful take on individuality enduring beyond life.",
    "20240101_182448.jpg": "This image is amusing because it highlights a common frustration that travelers experience. The left side shows a suitcase with wheels, which implies ease of travel. However, the right side contradicts this with an image of cobblestone pavement, notorious for making wheeled luggage difficult to pull. The humor lies in the unexpected reality check that, despite modern conveniences, sometimes obstacles like uneven surfaces can complicate even simple tasks.",
    "20240101_172417.jpg": "The image is humorous because it juxtaposes two scenarios where people commonly say \"Yes, but...\" The left side shows a Wi-Fi login where the password is extremely long and complicated, which is a situation where someone might begrudgingly accept free Wi-Fi despite the annoyance. The right side shows a bank keypad, implying someone could be hesitantly admitting to knowing their PIN despite the risk of sharing sensitive information. The contrasting situations play on the reluctance we often feel in daily inconveniences and security measures.",
    "20240101_174842.jpg": "This image humorously juxtaposes two contrasting scenes: the 'YES' panel shows a relaxed business class flight experience, while the 'BUT' panel exaggerates the discomforts of economy class by likening it to a cramped ride inside an overhead baggage compartment. This hyperbole highlights the stark differences in comfort and space between the two cabin classes, using the unrealistic and comical scenario to satirize the disparities in air travel.",
    "20240101_182629.jpg": "The humor in this image stems from the juxtaposition of high expectations with reality. It presents a 5-star rating which typically suggests excellence, but the satire emerges when you notice that the rating is based on a single review. This undermines the credibility of the perfect score, implying that statistical significance is lacking, and thus, the rating might not be a reliable indicator of quality.",
    "20240101_181101.jpg": "This image humorously highlights the contrast between one's appearance when standing normally and when seated, which often causes clothes to bunch up and creates bulges\u2014even in people with flat stomachs. The satire lies in the common insecurity many feel about their bodies due to such natural changes in appearance, poking fun at the unrealistic beauty standards perpetuated by society and social media.",
    "20240101_182604.jpg": "The image is humorous because it presents a common frustration in public restrooms: the contradiction of promoting hygiene with touchless soap dispensers (labeled \"YES\") juxtaposed against the need to pull a potentially germ-laden door handle to exit (labeled \"BUT\"). This satirical take highlights the lack of foresight in design that undermines the cleanliness efforts by having to touch a dirty surface immediately after washing hands.",
    "20240101_175722.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on the common knowledge that rubbing alcohol is used to disinfect the skin before an injection, which is a sensible and expected procedure. However, the second panel humorously juxtaposes this by showing an opposite and absurd situation\u2014a person applying hand sanitizer to their arm as if to sanitize it before an injection, which is neither effective nor a medical practice, highlighting an exaggerated and nonsensical interpretation of hygiene.",
    "20240101_173654.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the concept of \"invisible tape.\" Normally, invisible tape appears nearly transparent after application, but the tape itself is visible on the roll. The joke here is that the tape is literally invisible, even on the roll, leading to a scenario where it's impossible to see or use the tape, thus humorously defying the product's practicality.",
    "20240101_173518.jpg": "The image is humorous and satirical because it portrays a situation where someone urgently looks up a life-saving first aid video, presumably to help someone in need, only to encounter a frustratingly irrelevant advertisement for a burger before the video. This highlights the absurdity of having to watch ads during critical moments, thereby critiquing the placement of advertisements in online video content.",
    "20240101_180706.jpg": "This image is satirical because it shows a discrepancy between the hotel's self-rating as a five-star establishment and its lower customer rating as a three-star hotel on a review platform. It humorously points out how businesses might oversell themselves, while customers' experiences provide a more realistic evaluation.",
    "20240101_174737.jpg": "This image plays on the phrase \"Yes, but,\" which often introduces a contradictory statement. Visually, it's humorously literal\u2014a person in a cafe looks content until they view a scene outside labeled \"but,\" featuring a dog relieving itself against a tree. The unexpected and somewhat crude nature of the outside scene serves to comically undercut the initial serene cafe setting.",
    "20240101_173205.jpg": "The image is humorous because it highlights a common contradiction in human behavior. The left side shows a phone's battery critically low at 15%, yet the screen indicates an urgent suggestion to charge it, which the user acknowledges with \"YES.\" However, the right side shows the user continuing to take screenshots even as the battery life diminishes further to 17%, indicated by \"BUT,\" suggesting an amusing disregard for the initial urgency and a preference for capturing the moment over maintaining the device's power.",
    "20240101_173706.jpg": "The image is humorous because it juxtaposes the concept of e-scooters as a convenient mode of transportation (\"YES,\") against the reality of poorly-parked scooters cluttering sidewalks and posing as a tripping hazard (\"BUT\"). It highlights the paradox of how something meant to aid mobility can ironically impede it when not used responsibly.",
    "20240101_172317.jpg": "The image presents a humorous take on expectations and reality concerning tattoos in professional settings. On the left side, a man is fully suited with tattoos visible on his hands and neck, suggesting a blend of formality with personal expression. On the right, the suit is removed revealing extensive tattooing which is often less accepted in professional environments, humorously contrasting the \"acceptable\" appearance with surprising underlying reality. The \"YES, BUT\" captions add to the comedic effect of the juxtaposition.",
    "20240101_172339.jpg": "The image plays on the idea of hidden quirks or personal expressions within conventional or serious appearances. The man presents a professional, perhaps somber image with his suit and pose on the left, labeled \"YES,\" suggesting an expected, straightforward presentation. However, \"BUT\" introduces something unexpected \u2014 his colorful, fun socks contradict his otherwise serious exterior, revealing a touch of individuality or nonconformity.",
    "20240101_173936.jpg": "The image is humorous because it shows the contrast between the idealized expectation of enjoying a beloved music playlist signified by a heart symbol, versus the reality of frequently skipping songs, as depicted by a finger poised over the skip button. This satirical take pokes fun at the common behavior of compiling playlists of favorite songs but then often skipping through them to find the perfect track to listen to in the moment.",
    "20240101_175847.jpg": "The image is humorous due to the irony presented. It shows a pair of scissors packaged in a plastic clamshell which is notoriously difficult to open and often requires scissors to cut through. The joke lies in the fact that the very tool needed to open the packaging is trapped inside of it, creating a comical catch-22 situation.",
    "20240101_180832.jpg": "This image is a humorous play on the phrase \"Yes, but,\" illustrating a juxtaposition of intention and action. On the left, a shopping cart filled with healthy foods suggests a choice towards a healthier lifestyle. On the right, however, the trunk of a car, packed with large speakers, implies a continued investment in a party lifestyle, thereby undermining the initial healthy intent with a contrasting hobby or vice.",
    "20240101_173043.jpg": "The image humorously illustrates a common contradiction in eating habits where a person opts for a \"diet\" or \"no sugar\" beverage like diet cola while simultaneously choosing to consume a large, calorically dense meal such as fries and a big burger with cheese and sauce. It satirizes the idea of making a token healthy choice while indulging in high-calorie food, which undermines the intention of dieting or consuming fewer calories.",
    "20240101_173729.jpg": "This image humorously contrasts expectations versus reality. On the left, a man perceives a woman getting ready as a quick task (\"YES\"), signified by her standing poised with a clock indicating punctuality. On the right, the panel titled \"BUT\" shows the actual complexity and time it takes for a woman to get ready, with the man impatiently waiting while eating and drinking in the car, implying a comically long wait.",
    "20240101_172902.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the meme format \"Yes, but,\" typically used to acknowledge a statement before presenting a contrasting or contradictory situation. In this case, the first panel shows a person from above, seemingly bald. In the second panel, the \"but\" reveal shows the person is actually fine-haired, flanked by characters expressing exaggerated surprise, subverting the expected baldness with an unexpected perspective shift.",
    "20240101_174853.jpg": "The image is a humorous take on the phrase \"Yes, but\"\u2014typically used to acknowledge a point before presenting a contradiction or exception. The joke visually represents this conversational pivot by showing a glass of water labeled \"YES,\" which is agreeably full, but suddenly tipping over as \"BUT,\" humorously illustrating the way the word can disrupt or overturn a previously affirmative statement.",
    "20240101_181439.jpg": "This image humorously contrasts the expectation of a perfect, serene morning with the reality of a messy one. The first panel shows an idyllic start to the day with a tidy bed, a cup of coffee, and breakfast, suggesting a calm and controlled scenario. The second panel reveals the bed stained and crumbs scattered, poking fun at how actual mornings often don't live up to the idealized versions we envision or see in media.",
    "20240101_182338.jpg": "The image is humorous because it juxtaposes the achievement of a fitness goal with an unexpected and ironic reality. On the left, a person's fitness watch celebrates reaching 10,000 steps, typically a sign of a healthy, active lifestyle. However, the right side reveals that the steps were achieved not through exercise, but by pacing in an elevator, subverting the usual context in which such a milestone would be met.",
    "20240101_182506.jpg": "The image humorously highlights the stark contrast between the front and back view of a person\u2019s pants. From the front, the pants appear pristine and well-maintained, but the rear view reveals an unkempt, stained condition, implying that appearances can be deceiving and that one may try to present a put-together fa\u00e7ade while hiding a messier reality.",
    "20240101_173144.jpg": "The image is humorous because it highlights a contradiction in behavior. On the left, a person is actively using a stair-climbing machine to exercise, which indicates a desire for physical activity. Yet on the right, the same person chooses to take an elevator instead of using the actual stairs, which would have provided similar physical benefits to the exercise machine. This satirical illustration pokes fun at how people sometimes make choices that are inconsistent with their goals or beliefs.",
    "20240101_174536.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the literal interpretation of door signs. The first panel shows a door marked \"OPEN,\" suggesting the door is to be pushed to open, yet the character pulls the door, as many people mistakenly do. The second panel cleverly subverts expectations with a door marked \"CLOSE,\" leading the character to press his back against it, comically literal and yet impractical, poking fun at human tendencies to misinterpret instructions.",
    "20240101_174000.jpg": "The image portrays a king-sized bed, but humorously, the word \"king\" has been taken literally to depict an actual king spread out on the bed, complete with a crown and scepter. It plays on the dual meaning of \"king size\" - typically referring to a large bed size, but in this cartoon, it includes a comical representation of a king occupying the space, hence the jest \"YES, BUT.\"",
    "20240101_173214.jpg": "The image is a humorous take on the phrase \"Yes, but...\" which often precedes an excuse or contradiction. The left side optimistically depicts a sun drawing on a house's wall, implying a child's simple, joyful activity. The right side reveals the reality: the drawing is done in permanent marker, turning the innocent act into a humorous, relatable parental nightmare of property damage. The joke lies in the twist that undermines the initial positive impression.",
    "20240101_173013.jpg": "The image is a humorous take on the common advice to drink more water for better health (\"YES, DRINK MORE WATER\"), contrasting it with the inconvenient consequence of frequent bathroom trips (\"BUT\"). The left side shows a glass being filled with water, whereas the right side depicts a long queue outside a restroom, playfully acknowledging the often overlooked practical implication of following this health tip.",
    "20240101_175554.jpg": "The image plays on the familiar phrase \"yes, but\" to present a literal comic twist. It humorously juxtaposes two items whose names sound like \"yes\" and \"but\"\u2014a \"yes\"ter, a form of yeast container, and a \"but\"ter sculpture. The jest lies in the unexpected literal representation of the conversational phrase, which typically precedes a counterargument, thereby creating an amusing contrast between language and visual interpretation.",
    "20240101_175031.jpg": "The image humorously depicts a situation where someone acknowledges a positive aspect, represented by money falling from the sky, with \"YES,\" but then immediately brings up a caveat or limitation with \"BUT,\" shown by the person having to patch up their shoe using the money. The satire lies in the exaggeration of how an ostensibly good fortune can come with unforeseen, ironic drawbacks, highlighting the complexity and hidden costs behind seemingly simple or advantageous scenarios.",
    "20240101_175237.jpg": "This image plays on the expectation versus reality motif. It humorously contrasts the ideal depiction of flip-flops with a tropical design (suggesting ease and vacation) against the reality of wearing them, which often involves the discomfort of the thong pressing between the toes. The \"YES, BUT\" text highlights this dichotomy, acknowledging the appeal of the sandals while pointing out their common, less comfortable aspect.",
    "20240101_181415.jpg": "The image humorously highlights the disparity in serving sizes shown on food packaging. On the left, a large pile of cookies is associated with the calories listed, suggesting that is the serving size. On the right, only three cookies are shown with the same calorie count, pointing to the often unrealistically small serving sizes that food labels present, satirizing how nutritional information can be misleading.",
    "20240101_175048.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the juxtaposition of a tote bag that advocates for environmental consciousness with the phrase \"Yes, but...\" while ironically being filled with plastic items, which are notorious for polluting the environment. This contradiction satirizes how some people may outwardly express a concern for the environment yet fail to live up to those standards in their daily actions.",
    "20240101_173010.jpg": "The humor in this image stems from the juxtaposition of a shoe having a sign that says \"Yes,\" implying a positive or affirmative action, like purchasing it because of the discounted price, but the chart on the right shows all sizes are unavailable. This satirically reflects the frustration of finding a good deal on an item only to realize it's out of stock.",
    "20240101_175942.jpg": "The image humorously highlights an inconsistency in messaging app features. The left side shows a \"View Once\" feature, meaning a photo will disappear after being seen. The right side alludes to circumventing this privacy feature by taking a screenshot, thus defeating the purpose of the \"View Once\" option. The satire lies in the juxtaposition of a feature meant for privacy with the ease of its exploitation.",
    "Screenshot_2024-01-01-17-55-08-129_com.twitter.android~2.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the expectation of professional massages where the practitioner typically uses their hands, only to reveal a surprise in which they instead use their nose. This twist subverts the viewer's expectations and the incongruity of using a nose for massage, which is not practical or typical, adds an element of absurdity that is often found in satirical cartoons.",
    "20240101_175608.jpg": "The image plays on the instant change of emotions in soccer when a goal is scored, followed by the disappointment of it being disallowed due to a Video Assistant Referee (VAR) decision for offside. The humor arises from the juxtaposition of triumphant celebration with the abrupt, anticlimactic text, capturing the modern frustrations fans and players often feel with VAR disrupting the flow and initial excitement of the game.",
    "20240101_174544.jpg": "This image employs irony to highlight a paradox in human behavior. On the left, a person is afraid of a barking dog, suggesting a negative or fearful stance toward dogs. However, on the right, the same individual appears to altruistically donate to a dog shelter, indicating a caring attitude towards dogs' welfare. The humor arises from the contradiction between the person's fear of an actual dog and their simultaneous support for dogs in need, poking fun at the complex nature of human reactions and values.",
    "20240101_182638.jpg": "The image presents a humorous take on the concept of packaged food with deceptive labeling. The first panel shows a happy chicken, suggesting that the eggs are from a contented animal. The second panel reveals a much less idyllic reality, where numerous chickens bearing the same \"happy\" label are crammed together, poking fun at the often misleading marketing claims about animal welfare.",
    "20240101_175614.jpg": "The image employs irony to point out a contradictory stance. The left panel shows a person holding a sign that reads \"ACAB,\" an acronym critical of police. However, the right panel shows the same person dialing 112, the European emergency number for services including the police. The humor lies in the person's reliance on the very institution they criticize when in need of help.",
    "20240101_173624.jpg": "This image uses illustration to satirize the perceived contradiction in promoting electric cars as purely \"eco-friendly.\" The \"Yes\" panels suggest an idealistic view of electric vehicles, surrounded by signs of nature and cleanliness. The \"But\" panel introduces the environmental impact of car battery production, a less discussed aspect that complicates the \"green\" image, before returning to the initial simplistic view in the last panel.",
    "20240101_172838.jpg": "The image plays on the meme format \"Yes, but\" to humorously illustrate the all-too-familiar experience of clothing shrinking after a wash. The first panel optimistically presents a \"Monday\" shirt, but the second panel shows the shirt comically reduced to a miniature size alongside clothes hanger icons, suggesting that it's no longer wearable by an adult. The satire lies in the discrepancy between expectations of laundry and the often disappointing reality.",
    "20240101_173756.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on the common trope of fortune-tellers predicting the future, but instead of revealing something mystical or expected, the crystal ball displays a modern and mundane \"unknown error\" message, typically seen on electronic devices. The juxtaposition of mystical foresight with a frustrating technical glitch highlights the unpredictability of technology and life's uncertainties, thereby poking fun at the reliability of future predictions.",
    "20240101_173638.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the expectation versus reality trope. The left side shows a muscular person with a \"Kill\" tank top, suggesting intense workouts and a hardcore attitude, while the right side reveals a softer side, with protein powders sporting cute and less intimidating labels like \"teddy,\" \"vanilla,\" and \"strawberry unicorn,\" poking fun at the contrast between a tough exterior and a love for sweet, whimsical things.",
    "20240101_180947.jpg": "The image is a play on the phrase \"Yes, but,\" which is often used to acknowledge a point before presenting a contrasting view. Here, \"yes\" shows a line of ducklings following a mother duck, typically seen as cute and harmless. In contrast, \"but\" shows the same ducks heading into a \"Peking Duck\" restaurant, humorously implying an ominous fate, given that Peking duck is a famous duck dish. This juxtaposition creates a darkly humorous twist.",
    "20240101_172834.jpg": "The humor in this image stems from the play on the phrase \"yes, but,\" which is commonly used to agree with a statement before presenting an opposing view or condition. The twist here is a literal interpretation, showcasing a bus with the left side labeled \"YES,\" while the right side, slightly elevated, is \"BUT,\" suggesting a comical scenario where the sides of the bus are being referred to rather than a conversational exchange.",
    "20240101_172858.jpg": "This image humorously contrasts the effort and messiness of carving a pumpkin to extract its seeds with the ease of simply buying a pack of pumpkin seeds. It plays on the idea that while some may enjoy the traditional experience of pumpkin carving, modern convenience offers a shortcut that bypasses the labor and mess for an immediate snack.",
    "20240101_172400.jpg": "The image plays on the common phrase \"Yes, but,\" which often introduces a contradiction or exception. Here, one traffic light depicts a \"No Bicycles\" signal, while the adjacent pedestrian signal cleverly incorporates a bicycle in its \"Stop\" hand signal. This humorously implies a contradictory message to cyclists: they're told not to proceed yet are also symbolically stopped by the very same means they're supposedly prohibited from using. It's a visual pun presenting conflicting instructions.",
    "Screenshot_2024-01-01-18-15-32-614_com.twitter.android-edit.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on the phrase \"yes, but\" often used to acknowledge a point before presenting a contrasting or limiting view. The first panel shows a character optimistically affirming with \"YES,\" arms open wide. In the second panel, the \"BUT\" is literally illustrated by the character standing on a \"butt\" shaped cliff, humorously visualizing the word \"but\" as a physical barrier or limitation to the initial positivity.",
    "20240101_175836.jpg": "The image humorously juxtaposes the hopeful action of sending out a resume with the reluctance to answer a call from an unknown number. It satirizes the common behavior of job seekers who eagerly apply for positions but exhibit skepticism and hesitation when it comes to unknown calls, potentially from employers, reflecting the modern aversion to answering calls from unfamiliar sources.",
    "20240101_174813.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on the expectation of the continuity of a scene. In the first panel, we see a person inside a caf\u00e9 with the word \"Caf\u00e9\" prominently featured, implying normalcy. In the second panel, the \"but\" follows with the humorous twist\u2014a person walking a dog, but the dog is human-shaped and walking on hands and feet, subverting the anticipated image of a normal dog walk.",
    "20240101_173232.jpg": "This image humorously illustrates a common frustration among TV viewers: having to adjust the volume frequently because dialogue is too quiet and action scenes are too loud. The first panel shows the character comfortably listening to dialogue at a moderate volume, but in the second panel, he is startled and forced to lower the suddenly too-loud volume during an action sequence, a situation many can relate to.",
    "20240101_173210.jpg": "The image humorously comments on the differing beauty standards applied to men and women. The left panel shows a woman tearing up a paper labeled \"Beauty Standards\" with a diagram of an unrealistically proportioned female figure, signaling rejection of unrealistic expectations for women. The right panel shows her holding a similar paper for men with an ordinary figure, suggesting a lower standard for male attractiveness, which she accepts with hearts, indicating approval. The satire lies in the double standard and the acceptance of more diverse male body types compared to the idealized female form.",
    "20240101_180037.jpg": "The image is humorous because it contrasts the idealistic nature of appreciating a beautiful sunset with the stark, less romantic reality often encountered in urban settings. The first panel shows a picturesque sunset with clouds and a crescent moon, invoking a sense of serenity. The second panel introduces an obstructive view of power lines and an electricity pole, which disrupts the idyllic image, humorously highlighting the intrusion of modern infrastructure on natural beauty.",
    "20240101_180159.jpg": "The image juxtaposes the concept of a healthy caf\u00e9, typically associated with well-being and nutritious food, with a designated smoking area right beside it. This contrast is humorous because it points out the irony of promoting health in one instance while simultaneously accommodating an unhealthy habit such as smoking. The \"Yes, But\" caption emphasizes the contradiction.",
    "20240101_174232.jpg": "This image is humorous because it captures the ubiquitous human experience of being given mixed messages, personified here by traffic lights. On the left, a standard 'walk' signal invites pedestrians to proceed, but the scene on the right humorously contradicts it with a challenging and absurd obstacle course of moving vehicles, suggesting a 'yes, but' caveat to the straightforward instruction, creating an ironic and satirical situation.",
    "20240101_173054.jpg": "The image is humorous because it highlights a common contradiction: displaying an \"Anti Capitalist\" sticker while seemingly participating in a capitalist system, using a laptop and smartphone, possibly from major corporations. The joke is about the perceived inconsistency between one's stated beliefs and their actions, suggesting a superficial commitment to the ideology.",
    "20240101_182531.jpg": "The image is humorous because it juxtaposes the marketing of smartphones as \"ultra slim\" with the ironic reality that these thin devices often require bulky external battery packs to maintain charge throughout the day. This contrast highlights the practicality versus the aesthetics of phone design, poking fun at the compromise between sleekness and battery life.",
    "20240101_174848.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the concept of a \"disposable razor\" and takes it literally, implying that the razor is for disposing of a drawn-on beard instead of shaving actual stubble. By including the cartoon of a man removing a fake, penciled beard, it satirizes the principal function of a razor, adding a layer of absurdity to the scenario.",
    "20240101_173159.jpg": "This image plays on the concept of someone acknowledging a correct course of action but choosing an alternative, impractical method. The \"YES\" panel shows a trash can, suggesting the obvious action is to dispose of rubbish there. However, the \"BUT\" panel humorously depicts a hand discarding a piece of gum under a table, a common but improper action, thereby highlighting a contrast between societal expectations and individual behavior.",
    "20240101_180332.jpg": "The image humorously depicts the notion of privacy, contrasting expectation and reality. In the first panel, \"YES,\" we see an empty bathtub by a window, suggesting the possibility of bathing in private. The second panel, \"BUT,\" humorously subverts this by showing a person in the tub, now with a bird on the window sill appearing to look in, whimsically highlighting the unexpected ways privacy can be compromised.",
    "20240101_173227.jpg": "The image is humorous because it highlights the often illogical nature of human behavior, particularly while driving. It shows two scenarios: in the first panel, vehicles maintain a safe following distance; in the second, the car dangerously overtakes the truck only to continue at nearly the same speed, suggesting a needless and risky maneuver for a negligible gain, a comment on how drivers sometimes prioritize getting ahead over practicality and safety.",
    "20240101_180032.jpg": "This image jokingly depicts the common conversational pattern where someone acknowledges a point (\"Yes\") but quickly follows it with a contrary or deflecting statement (\"But\"). The humor lies in the unlikely and absurd comparison of teeth with a cannon, suggesting a dramatic escalation or overreaction that comically misses the proportionality of a typical \"yes, but\" exchange.",
    "Screenshot_2024-01-01-18-12-18-789_com.twitter.android-edit.jpg": "The image is humorous because it juxtaposes two opposing attitudes toward reading. On the left, the individual proudly proclaims a love for reading, depicted upside down, immersed in a book. On the right, the same love for reading is humorously questioned, as the individual nonchalantly skips reading the lengthy terms and conditions, a common practice that highlights the irony of not reading despite claiming to love it.",
    "20240101_175353.jpg": "The image is humorous and satirical because it plays on the common phrase \"Yes, but,\" which often introduces an objection or contrasting point. In the first panel, it appears to simply depict a peaceful ocean view from a window. The second panel humorously takes the phrase literally, showing a giant hand pouring an excessive amount of water, flooding the city, thus turning the phrase into a literal and absurd scenario. The juxtaposition of the calm scene with the surprising and over-the-top interpretation of the conjunction is what makes the image amusing.",
    "20240101_173000.jpg": "This image satirizes situations where someone is willing to casually handle food with their bare hands but hesitates or avoids direct contact when it comes to money, suggesting a perceived higher level of contamination or disdain for physical currency. It humorously juxtaposes the direct contact with food against the careful handling of money, often seen as dirtier, with gloves or other barriers.",
    "20240101_180319.jpg": "This image plays on the phrase \"Yes, but,\" which typically precedes an objection or alternative viewpoint to an initial statement. It humorously contrasts two scenes: a vibrant bouquet of flowers symbolizing life and positivity (\"Yes\"), and the same bouquet with a tombstone, suggesting mortality and the end (\"but\"). The satire lies in the unexpected grim turn and implies that every positive situation has a potential negative counterpart.",
    "20240101_180335.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on the contrast between formal dining etiquette and the informal act of eating sushi with chopsticks. On the left, the character seems ready for an elegant meal with multiple utensils, while on the right, she casually dips sushi into soy sauce, highlighting the quirky inconsistency between the two dining styles. It satirizes how cultural expectations can shift suddenly and whimsically between different eating scenarios.",
    "20240101_174213.jpg": "This image is satirical because it plays on the concept of the word \"but\" as a qualifier that changes the perception of a statement. The first panel shows a car with camouflage paint, which suggests concealment, but the second panel humorously contrasts this by showing the car with large, conspicuous wheels that are highly noticeable, thus negating the purpose of camouflage. It's a play on expectations versus reality.",
    "20240101_180927.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on the trope of parents shielding their children from nudity or sexual content on TV or in movies. The adult covers the child's eyes during a scene with implied nudity but seems unconcerned about exposing the child to violence, as hinted at by the image of a man holding a weapon on the right. The satire here is about society's tolerance of violence in media while being prudish about natural human nudity.",
    "20240101_173642 (1).jpg": "The image is satirical because it humorously showcases a common behavior where people often choose to carry multiple grocery items by hand, despite having an empty shopping basket available. The juxtaposition of the underused basket in the first panel with the overladen arms in the second highlights the absurdity of avoiding the basket's designed convenience.",
    "20240101_182246.jpg": "This comic uses the \"Yes, But\" format to illustrate the common experience of expectation versus reality. The first panel shows a perfect-looking strawberry cake from a recipe, setting a high expectation. The second panel humorously reveals the actual, less appealing homemade cake, reflecting how real-life attempts often don't match idealized examples. The third panel adds a further twist, with a robot vacuum mistakenly trying to clean the messy cake, highlighting the absurdity and escalating the situation comedically.",
    "20240101_180844.jpg": "The image humorously depicts the contradiction between the sticker \"YES BUT\" on the vehicle and the person's parking behavior. The driver seems to agree with good parking practice in principle (\"YES\"), but the way the car is actually parked across two spaces suggests a disregard for the rule (\"BUT\"), highlighting a common tendency to rationalize poor etiquette.",
    "20240101_175808.jpg": "This image juxtaposes a popular motivational phrase, \"Beauty is Inside,\" with an illustration of a woman using beauty products, implying a literal interpretation. The humor arises from the contradiction between the abstract idea that beauty comes from within and the literal action of applying makeup, a superficial enhancement.",
    "20240101_172351.jpg": "This image humorously juxtaposes two seemingly unrelated situations through a play on the phrase \"yes, but.\" On the left, a man is seen grilling what appears to be bread, suggesting the word \"yes\" could relate to the affirmative action of making toast. The right side unexpectedly contrasts with a visual pun\u2014assorted buns and pastries on a toilet seat, playing on the word \"butt,\" creating a humorous twist on the anticipation from the first panel. It's funny because it subverts expectations with a literal interpretation of homophones.",
    "20240101_173341.jpg": "This image is humorous because it juxtaposes romantic expectations with a comical reality. On the left, there's a depiction of a couple in a serene and intimate pose, with the tranquil \"Yes.\" In contrast, the right side reveals the punchline \"But,\" where the idyllic image is disrupted by an uncomfortably hot temperature, shown by the thermometer, causing the man to sweat profusely. It's funny because it subverts the expectation of a flawless, romantic scenario with a far less glamorous, but relatable, situation.",
    "20240101_180758.jpg": "This image is humorous because it depicts a common situation for cat owners. The left side shows a scratching post labeled \"YES,\" implying it's the appropriate place for the cat to scratch. The right side shows the cat ignoring the scratching post and opting to scratch the couch instead, with \"BUT\" implying the cat's disregard for the owner's preference. It's funny due to the cat's typical mischievous behavior, which cat owners often experience.",
    "20240101_172936.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on the common experience of following traffic rules versus facing drivers who bend them. The \"YES\" side shows cars orderly in their lanes, while the \"BUT\" side illustrates one car straddling lanes, a typically frustrating and often criticized driving behavior, undermining the expected order on the road. The contrast between the ideal and the real-world situation is a typical source of satirical humor.",
    "20240101_180802.jpg": "This image is satirical as it contrasts human and pet behavior in emergencies. On the left, a person is saving a puppy from a fire, displaying heroism and compassion. On the right, humor arises as it shows a dog seemingly indifferent to the burning house, calmly sitting outside its kennel. The juxtaposition highlights the oddity of the dog's reaction, subverting expectations of a panic-driven escape, which makes it humorous.",
    "20240101_182308.jpg": "The image juxtaposes two scenarios involving the word \"but.\" On the left, a woman is exercising with dedication, saying \"YES\" to physical effort. On the right, the humor arises because the \"BUT\" refers to avoiding physical exertion by choosing the elevator over stairs. It's satirical as it comments on the common contradiction between our intentions to be fit and our choices for convenience.",
    "20240101_173112.jpg": "This image is a two-panel comic that plays on the phrase \"yes, but.\" In the left panel, a person appears to take a photo of someone posing in front of a server room, suggesting the person is impressed or showcasing a technical accomplishment. The right panel counters this with a mundane office setting, humorously implying that, despite the initial appearance of excitement, the reality is just another ordinary workspace. The juxtaposition creates a humorous contrast between expectations and reality.",
    "20240101_180856.jpg": "This image humorously depicts a common procrastination scenario where a person has partially completed a task, showcasing a bin with a new trash bag beside it versus a bin with the bag properly installed. The \"YES, BUT\" text implies a self-acknowledgment of effort while also highlighting a reluctance or delay in finishing the job, evoking a sense of relatable irony about human laziness or procrastination.",
    "20240101_174055.jpg": "This image is satirical because it shows a person proudly displaying a medal for \"awareness\" on the left but then depicts the same person in various scenarios on the right actively ignoring or overlooking the issues they're supposedly aware of, suggesting a disconnect between advocating for a cause and taking meaningful action towards it.",
    "20240101_182357.jpg": "The humor in this image arises from the play on the phrase \"yes, but\" which is often used to agree with a statement before presenting a contrasting opinion or fact. The image visually literalizes this phrase by showing a fully clothed person in the first panel labeled \"YES,\" and then just the person's lower half, or \"butt,\" in the second panel. The joke is in the unexpected interpretation of the conjunction as a physical body part.",
    "20240101_173108.jpg": "The image contrasts an idealized or optimistic viewpoint with a more pessimistic or realistic one. The first panel, labeled \"YES,\" shows a person on a sunny mountain with rainbows, symbolizing a positive outlook. The second panel, \"BUT,\" shows the same setting but overcast and gloomy, reflecting a counterpoint to the initial positivity, often found in real-life scenarios where complications or less favorable aspects are considered.",
    "20240101_173921.jpg": "The image humorously depicts a common situation where good weather occurs during the workweek, as shown with sunny icons from Monday to Friday, and then deteriorates on the weekend, indicated by rain clouds on Saturday and Sunday. The punchline is the immediate return to sunny weather the following Monday, which is a playful nod to the perceived irony and misfortune of having nice weather when one is likely busy with work and bad weather when one might be free to enjoy it.",
    "20240101_175803.jpg": "This image humorously illustrates the often selective and stubborn behavior of dogs. On the left, various appealing dog toys are refused, indicated by \"YES,\" suggesting that the dog would normally show interest. On the right, under \"BUT,\" the dog chooses to fetch a cone instead, a commonly disliked object for dogs due to its association with veterinary visits, displaying the dog's unpredictably contrary nature, providing a satirical take on the dog's choice.",
    "20240101_174540.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the phrase \"Yes, but\"\u2014commonly used to acknowledge a point before presenting a contradictory view. Here the phrase is literally illustrated with a victorious boxer (implying \"Yes\") paired with his beaten opponent (implying \"But\"), humorously suggesting the opponent still has a differing perspective despite the clear outcome of the match.",
    "20240101_173141.jpg": "The image juxtaposes two panels labeled \"YES\" and \"BUT,\" using a robot and a human with a robot-looking arm to create a humorous play on the word \"yes, but.\" The first panel presents a full robot, aligning with the word \"YES,\" implying affirmation. The second panel humorously modifies the word \"BUT\" by depicting a human with just a robotic arm, creating a visual pun that plays with the dual meaning of \"but\" and the visual implication of a \"butt\" or behind, with the arm placement suggesting the pun.",
    "20240101_181146.jpg": "The image plays on the phrase \"Yes, but,\" which is often used to acknowledge a point before presenting a contrasting opinion or fact. It humorously illustrates this by depicting a person with a literal \"but\" or \"butt\" on their forehead, instead of correctly wearing the cap shown in the first panel. The joke lies in the visual pun, with the cap's orientation forming the wordplay.",
    "20240101_175247.jpg": "This image plays on the phrase \"Yes, but\" which commonly introduces an objection or counterpoint. Visually, it presents two structures resembling the word \"but\" - the first made of tickets labeled with various excuses, the second a bust of a muscular torso, suggesting a robust rebuttal. It humorously implies that while one might have many excuses (tickets), a strong counterargument (muscular bust) can dismiss them decisively.",
    "20240101_173029.jpg": "The image humorously contrasts the marketing of extra-large (\"XXL\") sausage packaging with the reality of the product being significantly smaller than advertised once taken out of the package. The exaggerated difference between expectation and reality, depicted through the packaging's large sausages versus the comically small size when held, satirizes misleading advertising practices.",
    "20240101_175647.jpg": "This comic is humorous because it plays on the expectation that the artist will paint the still life set up in front of them, consisting of a vase and fruit. Instead, in a twist, the artist has become distracted and paints a humorous, mismatched subject\u2014an anime character\u2014showing a comedic deviation from the initial artistic intention.",
    "20240101_180643.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the phrase \"yes, but\"\u2014implying an agreement with a caveat\u2014and visually represents it using two similar-looking images. On the left, there's an array of banknotes suggesting wealth (\"yes\"), while on the right, it's revealed that the money is actually Monopoly currency (\"but\"), which is worthless in real life, subverting the viewer's initial assumption of real wealth.",
    "20240101_180658.jpg": "The image plays on the phrase \"yes, but,\" typically used to acknowledge a statement before presenting a contrary point. Visually, it represents this using a stick (yes) and a \"butt\" (represented humorously by what looks like the backend of a cat sticking out of a trash can). It's funny due to the literal depiction of a conversational phrase using unrelated objects.",
    "20240101_180601.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on the expression \"Yes, but,\" which is typically used to agree with a statement before presenting an opposing view or exception. Here, the \"Yes\" is represented by an affirmative tick, while the \"But\" is humorously reinterpreted as a literal \"butt\" \u2013 the man is drinking from a mug shaped like a buttock. The joke lies in the visual pun, taking the word \"but\" from a verbal to a visual context in an unexpected way.",
    "Screenshot_2024-01-01-17-38-54-117_com.twitter.android-edit.jpg": "The humor in this image stems from the juxtaposition of a woman holding a sign saying \"YES\" in a positive environment, with people cheering around her, against a similar scenario where the sign says \"BUT,\" representing hesitation or conditions, yet the surrounding people remain enthusiastically supportive. It satirizes how adding a \"but\" can dramatically change the perception of a statement while the environment and support absurdly remain unchanged.",
    "20240101_172853.jpg": "This image humorously points out the common experience where airplane seat pockets, meant for small items, often contain very little space due to in-flight magazines and safety cards. The satirical contrast shows that while one might expect room for personal items (\"YES\"), the reality is there's barely any space left (\"BUT\"), exaggerated here with just a single thin laptop fitting snugly into the packed pocket.",
    "20240101_180754.jpg": "This image plays on the frustration commonly experienced when trying to scan a digital ticket from a mobile device. Even though e-tickets are designed for convenience, the humor arises from the exaggerated size of the printed ticket, mocking the idea that sometimes traditional methods are utilized to avoid technical issues, defeating the purpose of digital convenience.",
    "20240101_175752.jpg": "The image is humorous because it juxtaposes two contradictory behaviors regarding sun protection. On the left, a person diligently applies sunscreen labeled \"SPF++\" for skin protection.

    "20240101_175759.jpg": "This image is humorous because it exaggerates the act of procrastination. On the left, a person is shown writing an extensive to-do list, symbolizing good intentions and productivity. In contrast, the right side comically shows the same person on an autopsy table, implying they procrastinated to the extreme, until death, without accomplishing their tasks. The satire lies in the unexpected and hyperbolic outcome of chronic procrastination.",
    "20240101_173355.jpg": "This image humorously depicts the discrepancy between the marketed storage capacity of a smartphone (256GB, as stated on the phone's box) and the actual available space that the user has access to once the operating system and pre-installed apps have taken their share (235.35 GB shown on the phone's screen). The satire lies in the often unmentioned truth that the advertised storage is never fully available for personal use, which can be a common frustration for consumers.",
    "20240101_175135.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the idea of the \"Yes, but\" meme format, which typically highlights a contradiction or impractical situation. The left side shows a pedestrian traffic light turning green, indicating it's safe to walk, while the right side shows an unexpected obstacle\u2014a bus blocking the crosswalk\u2014rendering the signal moot, thus creating a satirical contrast between the expectations of the pedestrian signal and the reality of the blocked path.",
    "20240101_173525.jpg": "The image satirizes the overwhelming and often dense nature of medicine instructions. It shows an excessively large and detailed instruction leaflet compared to the tiny pill, humorously exaggerating how complicated and daunting pharmaceutical guidelines can feel to a consumer who expects simple, straightforward advice.",
    "20240101_172947.jpg": "This image plays on the phrase \"Yes, but,\" humorously depicting literal interpretations of agreement followed by contradiction. On the left, clothes spell out \"YES,\" implying agreement or positivity.

The humor lies in the visual pun and the juxtaposition of an optimistic start with a contradictory and chaotic outcome.",
    "20240101_180618.jpg": "This image is humorous because it shows a common social scenario where one person asks another to text them upon safely arriving home. However, the satire emerges as the second panel reveals the person is already at home, asleep, implying they've forgotten or disregarded the request. The humor lies in the relatable oversight and the benign neglect of social expectations, creating a light-hearted joke on how sometimes we forget the simplest things once we're comfortable.",
    "20240101_173100.jpg": "The image plays on the idea of a power bank needing to be charged itself. The left panel says \"YES,\" showing a traditional use: a phone being charged by a power bank. The right panel, with \"BUT,\" humorously points out an often overlooked irony \u2013 even the power bank, which is meant to be a source of power on the go, relies on being tethered to an outlet for recharging, which seems to defeat its purpose of portability and independence.",
    "20240101_172928.jpg": "This image humorously emphasizes the nature of overcomplication or unnecessary additions when simplicity could suffice. The left side shows a simple, solid-colored 3x3 square, accompanied by the text \"YES,\" suggesting agreement or the right choice. The right side, with the text \"BUT,\" shows a complex, multicolored Rubik's Cube\u2014a puzzle known for its challenging solution\u2014implying that even when a simple solution is available, people often complicate matters without need.",
    "20240101_174119.jpg": "The image plays with the juxtaposition of adult life versus that of a baby. On the left, we see adults partying and having a good time, a scene often associated with freedom and joy. On the right, a baby mimics the action with a humorous twist\u2014the 'party' is actually a tantrum, and the 'drinking' is from a milk bottle, suggesting that both adults and babies have their unique ways of 'letting loose,' albeit with very different contexts and beverages.",
    "20240101_173017.jpg": "The image plays on the contrast between expectation and reality with a humorous twist. The first panel shows a flattering, confidence-boosting message \"You are cute,\" implying someone sees the person positively. The second panel reveals a reflection on the phone screen with a distorted, comical face, humorously undercutting the compliment and perhaps suggesting that our self-perception, especially in unflattering circumstances, can differ from how others see us.",
    "20240101_172420.jpg": "The image presents a humorous take on clothing sizes. On the left, a shirt simply states its size, while on the right, an absurdly long and detailed tag implies a complicated set of conditions or disclaimers that could apply to the size label, poking fun at how clothing sizes often don't seem straightforward and might come with unexpected \"buts\" or variations.",
    "20240101_180340.jpg": "The image humorously portrays the common scenario where a car is equipped with advanced safety features, such as a complex seatbelt system for a pizza\u2014indicating a concern for the safety of an inanimate object\u2014yet the driver, a human, appears to only have a basic seatbelt. This contrast exaggerates the lengths to which we go to protect commodities while poking fun at the simpler approaches we sometimes accept for our own safety.",
    "20240101_175231.jpg": "The image is satirical because it shows a smartphone with an excessively large camera (labeled \"MEGA CAMERA\"), poking fun at the trend of phones having multiple large lenses. Despite this advanced camera, the content in the gallery is humorously mundane, including trivial photos and screenshots of a calculator and settings, showcasing the contrast between the phone's capabilities and the user's ordinary use.",
    "20240101_175259.jpg": "This image is humorous because it depicts a child playing with toy cars in a room adorned with car-themed decor, indicating a passion for vehicles.

This satirizes how childhood dreams often clash with the less glamorous aspects of adult life.",
    "20240101_174200.jpg": "The image is a comic representation of the superficial nature of prompted positivity. The left side shows a person smiling broadly with the word \"SMILE!\" implying a demand for cheerfulness. The right side humorously contrasts this with a zoom-in on squished cheeks and awkwardness, highlighting the discomfort and unnatural feeling that can come from being told to smile on command.",
    "20240101_173800.jpg": "The image is humorous because it shows a contradiction between the expected convenience of a \"Fastpass Entrance\" and the actual situation, where the regular entrance has no line, while the fast pass entrance is crowded. The satire lies in the observation that sometimes services designed to save time, like fast passes, can become so popular that they ironically create more delay due to overcrowding, defeating their original purpose.",
    "20240101_174629.jpg": "The image is humorous because it satirizes the situation where one step is left to reach a goal before midnight, depicted on the left. However, once midnight passes, as shown on the right, a reset occurs, and the goal absurdly increases to 1000 steps, indicating a new day has started and the prior effort is essentially negated, exaggerating the frustration one might feel in such a scenario.",
    "20240101_173003.jpg": "This comic is satirical because it plays on the phrase \"Yes, but,\" which often introduces a complication to a seemingly straightforward situation. The first panel shows an artist painting a tranquil landscape. The second panel reveals a wave of flies disturbing the scene, humorously highlighting that reality often comes with unanticipated annoyances and complexities despite our more idealized or simplistic representations.",
    "20240101_173718.jpg": "This comic is humorous because it plays on the stereotype of cats being indifferent to human needs or desires. The human character appears to be in a moment of relaxation, looking out at a beautiful view, probably expecting affirmation with the word \"YES,\" only for the cat to casually obstruct the view and deliver a nonchalant \"BUT,\" indicating a typical feline disregard for the person's enjoyment of the moment.",
    "20240101_174134.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the phrase \"it's the thought that counts,\" suggesting that while gifts are appreciated, sometimes the financial cost takes precedence. The \"Yes, but\" caption shows a person gratefully receiving a personalized gift, while simultaneously highlighting the reality of modern expenses by showing the necessity of using a credit card, hinting at the underlying monetary concerns associated with giving and receiving gifts.",
    "20240101_174147.jpg": "The image is a satirical take on how people often use the phrase \"Yes, but\" as a way to acknowledge a point before introducing a contradictory argument or excuse. It humorously suggests that despite various obvious outcomes or situations, someone might still find a way to argue or justify a contrary position, even in absurd or clearly settled contexts.",
    "20240101_180751.jpg": "The image humorously contrasts the initial impression of a healthy salad with the subsequent act of saturating it with an excessive amount of sugary mayonnaise, which negates the salad's health benefits. Labeling the mayo as 'SUGARMIX' underscores the satire, critiquing how some individuals might undermine healthy eating intentions by adding disproportionate, unhealthy condiments.",
    "20240101_175627.jpg": "The image humorously depicts the common experience where a person wishes to wash just their hands under a tap but inadvertently activates a shower head above, resulting in an unwanted drenching. The first panel implies a simple action, \"YES,\" to just rinse hands, but the second panel, \"BUT,\" shows the unexpected and comical misfortune that follows, playing on a typical bathroom design trap.",
    "20240101_175107.jpg": "The image is humorous because it cleverly uses the common template of \"Yes, but\" to contrast two situations. The left panel indicates agreement with a clear mirror, symbolizing clarity and acceptance. The right panel humorously opposes with a foggy mirror and a power symbol, implying that although one acknowledges a point (\"Yes\"), they aren't fully ready to act upon it, as represented visually by the mirror\u2019s fog\u2014indicating hesitation or procrastination.",
    "20240101_180932.jpg": "This image is humorous because it depicts a paradoxical situation. A phone cleaning app is being advertised to help clear memory, but at the same time, the app cannot be installed precisely because the phone doesn\u2019t have enough memory. This irony serves to satirize situations where solutions are rendered useless by the very problem they intend to fix.",
    "20240101_181143.jpg": "The image humorously illustrates how people often seek the closest parking spot to their destination to minimize walking, even when a farther spot may provide easier parking or exit. The left panel shows a car parked right next to a 'P' sign, while the right panel reveals an empty, hassle-free parking area simply a few steps away. This satirical take pokes fun at the common human tendency to prioritize convenience at the cost of seemingly minor but practical benefits.",
    "20240101_182426.jpg": "This image humorously contrasts the clean, organized look of a digital desktop with the typically cluttered reality of a physical desk space. The \"YES\" panel suggests an affirmation of neatness and order while the \"BUT\" reveals the common chaos of actual work environments, playing on a relatable discrepancy between virtual tidiness and real-world mess.",
    "20240101_182451.jpg": "The image is humorous because it contrasts a user's online portrayal with a \"behind-the-scenes\" reality. On the left, the user, \"jessica92,\" presents herself as eternally youthful with a \"Forever Young\" birthday cake, implying she's turning 18 again, a playful denial of aging. The right side, however, humorously insinuates that this is a recurring act of denial, with multiple \"18 again\" celebrations, poking fun at people who exaggerate or misrepresent their age on social media.",
    "20240101_172336.jpg": "This image is humorous because it juxtaposes an elaborate gaming or work setup, which suggests activity and engagement, with a resting or sleeping figure in a minimalistic and somber coffin, highlighting a stark contrast. It satirizes the extent of investment some make in their technology-rich environments, only for the ultimate outcome to be the same for everyone, a final rest, often depicted simplistically.",
    "20240101_180958.jpg": "The image is humorous because it contrasts the reliance on technology with old-fashioned methods. On the left, we see a vehicle's reversing camera suggesting a high-tech way to assist parking. Yet on the right, the driver prefers to turn his head and look back, defaulting to a traditional approach despite the available technology, hence the \"Yes, But\" implying a preference for personal judgment over reliance on gadgets.",
    "20240101_174949.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on the common behavioral trope of dogs being both obedient and easily distracted or reluctant. The left panel shows items a dog would typically chase or play with, suggesting an action\u2014likely a command from an owner. The right panel shows the dog with a frisbee in its mouth, indicating a \"but\" scenario where the dog is acknowledging the command yet has its own agenda.",
    "20240101_180607.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the phrase \"yes, but\" to show a contradiction between expectations and reality. The first panel shows a woman with a shirt patterned with \"yes\" giving a confident pose, implying a positive, straightforward situation. The second panel reveals undergarments with \"but\" written all over them when she opens her shirt, humorously representing the hidden doubts, conditions, or exceptions that often follow the initial affirmation. The contrast between the two creates a comical twist on how people often agree in principle but have reservations.",
    "20240101_174903.jpg": "The image is humorous because it juxtaposes a person's stated preference for natural birdsongs and the serenity they represent with their contradictory behavior of listening to a rap song with explicit content in a similar setting. It satirizes how people might romanticize nature but choose modern and less serene alternatives in practice.",
    "20240101_180026.jpg": "This image humorously points out the irony in a product, dog shampoo, which is labeled both as \"Not Tested on Animals\" and ironically features a dog on its label. The satire lies in the contradictory messaging since the product's intended users are dogs\u2014animals themselves\u2014making the \"not tested on animals\" claim paradoxical and amusing.",
    "20240101_175535.jpg": "This image is satirical because it humorously contrasts the implied value of \"Limited Edition\" items with their real-world use. The left panel presents a pair of Limited Edition soccer cleats on a pedestal, suggesting they are valuable and should be treasured. The right panel undercuts this by showing the cleats being used to play soccer, getting them dirty and worn, which is their intended purpose. It pokes fun at the consumer culture that often places high value on exclusivity rather than practicality.",
    "20240101_172843.jpg": "This image plays on the words \"Yes, but\"\u2014a common phrase used to agree with a statement before presenting a contrasting idea\u2014and visually depicts it with a laptop (\"Yes\") and a tablet rear camera (\"butt\"). The humor arises from the literal interpretation of the homophones \"but\" and \"butt,\" with the camera placement comically representing a posterior.",
    "20240101_172407.jpg": "The image plays on the modern trend of documenting every moment on social media. It humorously contrasts the serenity and focus one might expect in the presence of a meditating Buddha figure with a person's need to pose for social media, indicated by the hashtag #praying. The \"Yes, but\" signifies an acknowledgment of a spiritual moment, yet prioritizes the social media post over the actual experience.",
    "20240101_175541.jpg": "This image is satirical as it juxtaposes someone painting a mural that advocates for environmental protection with the scene \"behind\" the wall, which reveals an environment littered with trash and pollution. It highlights the irony between the idealistic message being promoted and the neglected reality, critiquing a superficial commitment to environmental efforts while ignoring actual problems.",
    "20240101_175445.jpg": "The image plays on the theme of partial perspectives. On the left, a person seems to be lifting a winning team on a banner, embodying support and glory. On the right, the fuller picture reveals the person is simply cleaning the windshield of a bus, humorously juxtaposing the initial perceived grandeur with a mundane task. The satirical twist lies in how cropping an image can drastically change its context and meaning.",
    "20240101_175745.jpg": "The image is humorous because it juxtaposes two scenarios: one where a person appears to be holding up a smartphone to compare a picture of a mountainous landscape with the real view, and a second where the same comparison is attempted with a desktop computer. The absurdity of someone trying to match a static desktop monitor with a real-world scene playfully critiques our dependency on technology to experience nature.",
    "20240101_174225.jpg": "This comic uses the phrase \"Yes, but\" to humorously depict someone acknowledging a statement or situation before immediately contradicting it or presenting a counterargument. The imagery suggests a scenario where one might expect a person to start eating a healthy salad but then humorously reveals their preference for a less healthy burger and fries, subverting the expectation set by the salad. The comic reflects common rationalizations or inner conflicts regarding food choices.",
    "20240101_174958.jpg": "This image is satirical because it highlights the contradiction in agreeing to something in principle (the wheel \"Yes\") but then presenting an impractical solution or condition that negates the original agreement (the unusable bicycle \"But\"). It humorously comments on how people or organizations might ostensibly agree with an idea but then sabotage it with impractical stipulations.",
    "20240101_175413.jpg": "The image is humorous because it shows a chart categorizing various fruits, yet the person is placing a \"fruits\" label inside a \"Yes, but\" Venn diagram section, suggesting an exception or a condition applied to the straightforward category. This implies a pedantic or overly complicated approach to a simple concept, poking fun at tendencies to overthink or overcomplicate matters.",
    "20240103_213052.jpg": "The humor in this image arises from the juxtaposition of a traditional wood-burning fireplace against a modern digital representation of a fire on a television screen. The \"Yes, But\" caption suggests a comedic acceptance of the fireplace's warmth and ambiance, only to humorously reveal a less authentic, digital alternative that simulates the experience without the practical benefits of actual heat.",
    "20240101_181009.jpg": "The image is humorous because it highlights a common frustration with online accounts: the process of creating a strong password only to later struggle with remembering it. The left side shows the user creating a robust password, indicated as \"Strong,\" and the right side depicts the same user having seemingly forgotten that password at login, ready to click \"Forgot Password?\" This juxtaposition satirizes the often futile effort of making a secure password if one cannot recall it.",
    "20240101_172357.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the irony of owning a large, high-definition television but ultimately watching content on a much smaller screen within that TV, such as a show or video on a smartphone or tablet. It satirizes modern media consumption habits where despite having access to advanced technology, people often choose to view content on smaller, more personal devices.",
    "20240101_173326.jpg": "The humor in the image stems from the contrast between the expectation that someone should know important historical or political information, like the names of Presidents, versus trivial or personal details such as ex-partners' names. The joke suggests that the person has a skewed knowledge priority, memorizing personal relationship history over arguably more significant educational content, which is an ironic and relatable concept for many.",
    "20240101_175339.jpg": "The image plays on the common human experience of wanting to procrastinate or avoid a task. In the first panel, signified by \"YES,\" the person appears to have completed making the bed. However, in the second panel labeled \"BUT,\" it's humorously revealed that they merely smoothed the cover over a mess of sheets, suggesting a superficial effort that looks good until investigated further. The humor lies in the relatable nature of taking shortcuts and the twist between expectation and reality.",
    "20240101_173239.jpg": "This image humorously depicts the common experience of encountering unexpected challenges. The left panel shows a woman sitting confidently, while the right panel zooms in to reveal her uncomfortable body language\u2014tightening her thighs\u2014to maintain appearances. It's satirical because it contrasts the aspiration of seeming effortlessly poised with the concealed effort required behind the scenes.",
    "20240101_180247.jpg": "This comic strip portrays situations where the word \"but\" changes the context. A pot is boiling over, a phone receives multiple messages, an iron burns clothes, and a cat sleeps. The \"but\" implies disregard for the previous urgent situation, highlighting the comical procrastination or distraction, especially in the cat scenario, where the person's affection for the cat outweighs the importance of tending to the clothes.",
    "20240101_173119.jpg": "The image plays on the double meaning of \"Russian Blue,\" a breed of cat. In the first panel, the cat is simply blue-colored, leading the viewer to expect a typical depiction. But in the second panel, the \"Russian Blue\" is humorously interpreted as a cat performing a Russian dance move, subverting expectations and creating a visual pun that's both surprising and amusing.",
    "20240101_182252.jpg": "The image plays on the stereotype that vegans often announce their dietary choices unsolicited (indicated by the tattoo), while scientists, who might typically make significant discoveries (like a \"cure for cancer\" on the pipette), are portrayed as understated in contrast. This juxtaposition humorously implies that vegans are more likely to share their lifestyle than scientists are to boast about major achievements.",
    "20240101_175126.jpg": "The image humorously contrasts the care taken to create latte art, which is often appreciated for its aesthetic appeal, with the common action of stirring the coffee, which destroys the art. The joke lies in the recognition that while latte art is aesthetically pleasing, for most, it's secondary to the primary goal of blending sugar or milk evenly into the drink.",
    "20240101_174218.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the juxtaposition between following rules and embracing rebellion. On one side, there's strict adherence to not removing a mattress tag, highlighting a mundane, often ignored law. On the other, stickers are rebelliously placed on a laptop, signifying the common practice of personalizing one's possessions, often against product recommendations, thus creating a satirical contrast between trivial rule-following and everyday acts of harmless rebellion.",
    "20240101_182625.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays with the duality between the iconic symbolism of the Statue of Liberty, representing New York and America, and the reality of global manufacturing. The snow globe on the left declares \"New York,\" while the \"Made in China\" label on the container playfully points out how even the most patriotic souvenirs are often produced overseas, highlighting the irony of globalization.",
    "20240101_181404.jpg": "This image is humorous because it juxtaposes an idealized portrayal of enjoying nature with the reality of discomfort it can sometimes bring. The left panel shows a serene person embracing nature, suggesting a perfect communion with the environment. The right panel reveals the person's feet being assaulted by ants, highlighting the often overlooked annoyances that can occur when one actually engages with the natural world. The contrast between the idyllic expectation and the uncomfortable reality is the source of the satire.",
    "20240101_175217.jpg": "This image satirizes the contrast between the glamorous portrayal of boat life on social media versus the less glamorous reality.

On the right, the same person is humorously depicted dealing with seasickness, tagged with #cleansingthebody, humorously juxtaposing the idealized image with an uncomfortable truth about sea travel.",
    "20240101_172322.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays on the concept that pets, particularly dogs and cats, often have an adverse reaction to fireworks. The \"YES,\" panel suggests a celebration is happening with colorful fireworks, but the \"BUT\" panel humorously contrasts this with the reality of pet owners, showing pets hiding in fear, implying that festivities can be less enjoyable for our furry friends.",
    "20240101_175155.jpg": "This comic is humorous because it plays on the idea of someone eagerly agreeing to a task without considering the practical implications, only to be faced with an obvious obstacle. The character says \"Yes,\" indicating readiness to move a large sofa through a door, but the \"But\" panel hilariously reveals that the sofa is far too large for the doorway, a predicament often encountered in real-life scenarios involving moving furniture.",
    "20240101_182549.jpg": "This image humorously juxtaposes the intended use of an exercise bike with how it is often used in reality. The left side shows the bike ready for use, captioned \"YES,\" implying agreement with its fitness purpose.

    "20240101_173039.jpg": "This image employs irony to comment on societal acceptance. The left panel shows enthusiastic support for a performer, signaled by \u201cYES,\u201d typically a universally encouraged scene. However, the right panel, with \u201cBUT,\u201d shows a same-sex couple holding hands, an act that often faces less acceptance, implying a contradictory societal stance where entertainment is readily embraced but equality in love still faces hurdles.",
    "20240101_181319.jpg": "This image is humorous because it contrasts two similar activities: rowing on a stationary exercise machine versus actual rowing in a boat. The wordplay with \"Yes, but\" suggests that while both actions mimic rowing, the latter provides a more authentic experience, possibly implying that modern exercise can seem somewhat paradoxical or redundant when compared to traditional physical activities.",
    "20240101_181054.jpg": "The humor in this image arises from a relatable situation where someone enjoys listening to music with headphones, seemingly unaware of their surroundings, saying \"YES.\" In contrast, the \"BUT\" panel humorously reveals that their music is so loud that it's actually emanating from their car, disturbing others outside, showing a lack of awareness of how their actions impact their environment.",
    "20240101_173552.jpg": "The image humorously contrasts the picturesque quality of a latte, often showcased with artistic foam designs (\"YES\"), with the reality of take-out coffee which is usually covered with a lid (\"BUT\"), obscuring any decorative effort. It satirizes the unexpected disappointment of not being able to appreciate the aesthetic aspect of coffee art due to practical packaging.",
    "20240101_182238.jpg": "The image is humorous because it contrasts two common situations where individuals are kept waiting for a response. On the left, someone is patiently waiting on a call with customer service, indicated by \"hold the line\" messaging. On the right, it satirically applies this patience to a personal text conversation where the sender is anxiously awaiting a reply, highlighting our often inconsistent standards for waiting in different contexts.",
    "20240101_172944.jpg": "This image satirizes how online shops often advertise sales that seem exclusive or time-limited to create a sense of urgency for consumers to make a purchase. The joke lies in the fact that the \"sale\" is repeatedly advertised as a one-day event, yet is being offered continuously, undermining the idea of a special, limited-time offer.",
    "20240101_172348.jpg": "The image humorously juxtaposes a decorated Christmas tree with a man placing one more ornament, which is typical holiday behavior, against a surreal situation in the second panel where the tree is playfully adorned with mundane items like a chair. The exaggeration and absurdity in the second panel, with the caption \"YES, BUT,\" satirize the idea of over-decorating or clutter, suggesting a comically unreasonable limit to holiday embellishment.",
    "20240101_175730.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the phrase \"Yes, but,\" often used to acknowledge a point before introducing a contrary opinion or fact. In this case, the literal interpretation is amusingly visualized with a bowl of soup labeled \"YES,\" followed by \"BUT\" represented by fallen croutons. The croutons no longer being in the soup suggests a breakdown or negation of the initial positive (\"yes\") statement, creating a witty visual pun.",
    "20240101_181411.jpg": "This image humorously uses the \"Yes, But\" format, a common meme template that signifies partial agreement followed by a caveat. The first panel suggests someone agreeing to a statement (\"YES,\"), while the second reveals a crowd of dissenters or conditions saying \"BUT\", implying a large-scale disagreement or a complex set of exceptions to the initial agreement. The joke lies in the visual surprise and the vast contrast between solitary acceptance and overwhelming objection.",
    "20240101_173605.jpg": "The humor in this image lies in contrasting the warm, human interaction offered by \"FREE HUGS\" with the cold, yet more popular appeal of \"FREE WIFI.\" It satirizes society's preference for digital connection over personal connection, highlighting how technology can overshadow the value of human touch and intimacy in today's world.",
    "20240101_180649.jpg": "This image is satirical because it plays on the theme of people agreeing in principle with an idea (symbolized by the \"YES\"), only to immediately introduce a stipulation or exception (implied by \"BUT\") that essentially negates the agreement. Here, the concept is illustrated through a car positioned to make a turn but obstructed by a parking line\u2014implying a commitment to rules but with an impractical adherence leading to an absurd situation.",
    "20240101_173647.jpg": "The image depicts a person playing a game typically accessible when there is no internet connection (the Chrome dinosaur game), but humorously, it shows a popup that says the game doesn't work without internet \u2014 a satirical twist given that this game is meant to be played offline when there's no internet connection. It's funny because it presents a contradictory situation to what users expect.",
    "20240101_174241.jpg": "The image is humorous because it depicts a contrast between expectation and reality. On the left side, a person is showcasing a collection of expensive basketball shoes, implying a level of expertise or involvement in basketball.

    "20240101_173712.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the phrase \"Yes, but\" as a lead-in to objections or excuses, while visually showing an array of beverages with smiling faces, seemingly eager to be consumed. Yet, the person depicted chooses to apply lipstick instead, humorously suggesting the lipstick application is the \"but\" in this context, prioritizing appearance over the enjoyment of drinks.",
    "20240101_182413.jpg": "The image is a satirical take on expectations vs. reality. On the left, the ballet is regarded as an elegant and cultural event (#cultural, #performance, #ballet, #art). On the right, the humor arises from an exaggerated, uncomfortable situation where a person falls asleep and potentially snores loudly (#but), subverting the initial sophisticated portrayal of attending a ballet.",
    "20240101_180636.jpg": "This satirical image contrasts the inflated self-image of a guitarist with the reality of their stage presence. It humorously depicts the guitarist seeing themselves as a dominant, attention-grabbing performer in one panel, while in the second panel, we see a more realistic view with the guitarist as a tiny figure on a vast stage, dwarfed by the setting, poking fun at the discrepancy between self-perception and reality in the context of performers.",
    "20240101_182235.jpg": "The image is humorous because it plays on the concept of a \"snake\" being in one's boot, a reference to a famous line from the movie \"Toy Story.\" Instead of a literal snake, the drawing shows a woman finding a belt in her boot, which she mistakes for a snake at first. The humor lies in the exaggerated and relatable fear of finding something unexpected where it shouldn't be.",
    "20240101_173642.jpg": "The image is humorous because it presents a common scenario where a person tells their dog \"Yes,\" as if agreeing to share food, but then adds a \"but\" implying a condition or refusal, which the dog likely does not understand. The dog's hopeful and attentive expression adds to the satire, as pets often expect to be given what their owners are eating regardless of any conditions stated.",
    "20240101_175820.jpg": "This image humorously contrasts the idea of a \"Relaxation Kit\" filled with calming items like bath salt and scented candles with an empty shower cabinet. It satirizes the often overly simplistic and unrealistic self-care trends that suggest small luxuries can provide relaxation, while the empty shower implies that without a bathtub, such products are pointless, poking fun at how modern life can undermine even our attempts at self-care.",
    "20240101_182242.jpg": "The image is a satirical take on the phrase \"Yes, but,\" which often introduces an objection or contradiction. The left side shows a zipper effectively closing a gap, aligning with \"Yes,\" indicating agreement or closure. The right side contradicts this by presenting train tracks misaligned, as if the \"but\" is interrupting or derailing the agreement, humorously visualizing the conversational twist that the phrase typically signifies.",
    "20240101_174719.jpg": "This image is humorous because it plays with the word \"but,\" implying a contrast between two situations. The first panel shows a pigeon flying gracefully with the text \"YES,\" suggesting an ideal or affirmative scenario. The second panel counters with \"BUT,\" revealing the pigeon in a more unflattering light: on the ground with a limp foot, typically caused by urban hazards, thus presenting a less ideal reality. The juxtaposition showcases the irony of expectations versus reality.",
    "20240101_173219.jpg": "The image humorously highlights the struggle of keeping white sneakers clean. On the left, \"YES,\" presents the ideal look of fresh, spotless shoes, while on the right, \"BUT,\" depicts the reality of maintaining them, showing a scuffed and dirty sneaker. It's a playful nod to the care and effort needed to preserve the pristine condition of white footwear, which is often thwarted by everyday wear and tear."
