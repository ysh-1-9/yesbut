The third image as well as it's caption is funny because it is an example of people misinterpreting or misunderstanding the content of the post and then getting offended or angry about it. The caption further emphasizes this by asking \"Why is the third image funny/satirical?\" when in fact the third image by itself is not really a joke or satire on its own. This further adds to the humor of the image as it highlights the tendency of people to react emotionally and uncritically to content without fully understanding it.",
    "20240101_173927.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because the image is showing a woman's luggage has been delayed yet the woman in the image is wearing the exact same outfit as the luggage so it is like the luggage is her and she has been delayed.",
    "20240101_174237.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows how rules that do not consider common sense and real life scenarios can lead to absurd situations. In this case, there is a pedestrian crossing signal that shows a green signal to the crossing pedestrians. However, the road is so narrow and there are cables hanging low enough at the far side of the road, so that it is impossible for the pedestrians to walk through without having to lower their heads and effectively become hunchbacks. This is a funny and satirical image because it shows how rules can be applied in a way that is impractical and inconvenient, and also shows that infrastructure may meet some rules on paper but fail to consider real-life situations or physical constraints.",
    "20240101_175847.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because the image shows a pair of scissors that are still attached to the package and yet the package is somehow opened. It's hard to open packages while the scissors are still attached to the package.",
    "20240101_181411.jpg": " The image is likely intended to be satirical in nature, as it plays on the idea of \"yes, but\" and how it can be used to dismiss or undermine something. It does this in a humorous way, by using the cat and the reverse camera as the examples. The image is likely intended to be humorous, as it plays on the idea of \"yes, but\" and how it can be used to dismiss or undermine something. It does this by using the cat and the reverse camera as the examples. In regards to the third example though, there is no punchline or answer to it, as it is simply asking a question. The question \"Do you mind if I sit here?\" is asked to the reader, and the reader's reaction to this question is not made clear. In a comedic scenario, the answer to the question \"Do you mind if I sit here?\" could be absurdly funny, or the question could be a setup to a punchline. The intention of the third example is to ask the reader \"Do you mind if I sit here?\", which is a normal question that is not particularly absurd on its own. Therefore, the third image is not funny/satirical in nature.",
    "20240101_175107.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows two contradictory actions. In the first part, the person was shown washing their hands in a sink to clean their hands. Then it shows a light switch that has a fingerprint scanner. The image implies that washing your hands before touching the switch did nothing because biometrics can unlock the device without checking for cleanness, which is opposite to the popular belief that we must be clean before touching things.",
    "20240101_175803.jpg": " The third frame is similar to the first one in that it is an unexpected punchline.\n\nIn the first frame, we expect the person in the cafe to react in some way to the nuclear explosion outside, but she doesn't. This is unexpected and funny.\n\nIn the third frame, we expect the chihuahua to run after the toys, but it goes after the shoe instead. The Chihuahua should want to go after the toys because dogs generally like toys. It is unexpected that the dog would run after the shoe instead. This is unexpected and funny.",
    "20240101_175820.jpg": " The image is funny because it shows a juxtaposition between the two images that are put together to create a humorous effect. The question that's been asked is \"Why is the third image funny/satirical?\" The response to that is because it's funny because it shows a juxtaposition between the two images that are put together to create a humorous effect. The image on the left shows a person looking at a poster that says \"Relaxation Kit, \" and the image on the right shows the person holding a baseball bat and golf club. It is a commentary on relaxation kits and how people often buy them to relax but instead of relaxing they use it to play sports or other activities that aren't necessarily relaxing.",
    "20240101_172354.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because the text on the shirt the man is wearing says: \"We work jobs we hate, to buy sh*t we don't need.\" This is funny/satirical because the man is sitting in an office setting and staring at a computer screen, implying that he likely works at a job that he hates and is therefore buying things he doesn't need in order to compensate for his dissatisfaction. This is a common theme in modern society where people work long hours at jobs they hate in order to afford material possessions that they don't need.",
    "20240101_173813.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows an office worker sitting on a chair that is too small for her, which is ironic because office chairs are typically designed to be comfortable for people to sit in for long periods of time. The woman looks uncomfortable sitting on the tiny chair. However, she is sitting on it anyways.",
    "20240101_174241.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because:\n\nThe image is a play on the idiom \"too many cooks spoil the broth\". It shows a basketball player surrounded by a lot of sneakers. The sneakers represent the different cooks, and the basketball player represents the broth. It is well known in Basketball that having too many star players (cooks) on a team often leads to conflict, as each player wants to be the star and take the most shots. This often leads to the team (broth) not being very successful.",

    "20240101_172357.jpg": " The third image is the question and it is funny/satirical because it shows a TV with a shelf on the side, with the TV showing a fireplace and the shelf having real logs on it, which is humorous because real logs are being placed in a TV shelf which is usually intended to place a set-top box, DVD player, and other things. This is funny because it is unexpected and visually humorous. It would be a clever solution to save space and provide a nice touch of ambiance.",

    "20240101_172414.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because in the image, a heavily dressed person is shown standing in the snow. The satirical part is that the person chose to keep their legs bare in the cold snowy conditions.",

    "20240101_181422.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows a man on a beach, who despite having a laptop and an almost dead battery, does not seem to be bothered by it. It could be satirical on a number of levels, but one level could be that today's society is so connected to technology, that it often feels like we cannot escape from it. Even while at the beach, the man appears still connected to his work as he responds to emails, cannot disconnect from his job, or perhaps is just pretending to work while at the beach.",

    "20240101_174218.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows how people easily get offended these days. People these days get triggered easily. For example, in the image, a man is seen getting offended over a meme on women and he says to stop bullying women but he doesn't realize that he himself is bullying someone by saying that just because of a meme. This is what the image is trying to convey that people should not get offended so easily.",
    "20240101_180515.jpg": " The image shows a waiter serving a plate with a fancy garnish. The plate has a smiley face made with food on the right side of the image, but if you look closely, the actual food design is a butt.

    "20240101_182506.jpg": " The third image is funny because its a play on words. The word \"but\" is written in the image. The phrase \"Yes, but\" is often used to introduce an objection or disagreement to someone else's point. The word \"butt\" in this image is a noun that refers to the buttocks. So the phrase \"Yes, butt\" is humorous because it is both a homophone of the phrase yes but and a reference to a person's butt.",

Another way of viewing the irony is the fact that the soda can says it's sugar-free, but the reality is that most diet sodas have artificial sweeteners which are equally as harmful as sugar for the body.",

However, the third image shows a truck going 81 km/h in a zone where the speed limit is 80 km/h, which is not a good thing.

Then, many of these same people are no longer interested in the child's life. This is a double standard because these people claim to be concerned with the sanctity of life, but their actions demonstrate otherwise. The image highlights this hypocrisy by showing how pro-life advocates are quick to condemn abortion, but then leave the women who choose to have children to fend for themselves.",

    "20240101_181006.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because The image is ironic and funny, because the window has a big net to avoid mosquitoes from coming inside but the person standing beside the window is protected by nothing and is at a greater risk of getting bitten by mosquitoes.",
    "20240101_173642.jpg": " The third image is a play on words. A dog has pizza on its face and the words \"yes\" and \"but\" is used to make it look like dog is saying \"yes\" and \"but\" but instead of the word \"but\" the image uses a paw that looks similar to the word \"but.\" This is funny because it makes it look like the dog is saying a funny response.",
    "20240101_180832.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because the picture shows a full grocery cart and a trunk full of groceries but the price at the register is just a penny. This image is absurd because it shows a lot of groceries but the price is a penny.",
    "20240101_180706.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because of the contrast the image creates of the real-life scenario of hotels having good ratings displayed on their websites or apps but in reality the ratings are much lower than displayed.",
    "20240101_182519.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows the hypocrisy of people who claim to support free speech but then block people who disagree with them. The image shows a person posting something about free speech, and then shows that they have blocked over a thousand people. This is funny because it shows that the person is not actually interested in free speech, but is only interested in promoting their own views.",
    "20240101_175023.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because even though the label says \"Mineral Water\", the ice cube tray is being filled with tap water.",
    "20240101_174518.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows an elephant on a seesaw with a man, however the seesaw is uneven as the man is much lighter than the elephant. The image is ironic, because even though elephants are very large and heavy, it does not necessarily mean that they are heavier than humans, or any other animal for that matter.",
    "20240101_181439.jpg": " The man is shown sleeping in crumpled bed sheets. The bed sheets are so crumpled that it is difficult to even make out that they are bed sheets. This is funny because usually when people sleep, they try to make sure that the bed sheets are as smooth as possible to ensure maximum comfort.",
    "20240101_182625.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows the Statue of Liberty in a snow globe with a \"Made in China\" sticker on it. On one hand, it is ironic because it shows that even the Statue of Liberty, which is often seen as a symbol of freedom and democracy, is made in China. On another, it could be seen as a commentary on the increasing presence of Chinese manufacturing in the global market.",
    "20240101_180026.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it is ironic that the shampoo bottle says \"Not tested on animals\" with a picture of a dog next to it. It implies that the shampoo was tested on animals, in this case, on the dog in the picture.",
    "20240101_175413.jpg": " The last image is funny/satirical because it plays on the age-old debate about what constitutes a fruit. The image shows a pie chart of fruits, with bananas, strawberries, grapes, apples, watermelon, oranges, and lemons. However, the pie chart is divided into two categories: \"Fruits\" and \"But Fruits\". Bananas, strawberries, grapes, and apples are in the \"Fruits\" category, while watermelon, oranges, and lemons are in the \"But Fruits\" category, implying that they are not real fruits. This is a humorous and satirical take on the debate about what constitutes a fruit, as it pokes fun at the fact that there is no clear consensus on the matter.",
    "20240101_173419.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because the image is ironic. In the picture, a big round moon is shown along with a night scene, which usually only appears once a month. On the other hand, a mobile phone application shows a full moon right above the building which is nearly impossible.",

    "20240101_172924.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it is using the similar context of the conversation from example 2 of the cat behind the man's face. Where \"yes, but\" is actually said from the fox mug. Which makes it a little bit different from example 1 and 2 where the second part is implied. In short because the text and the image match each other, unlike in the examples.",
    "20240101_173003.jpg": " The image is funny because it makes you think about expectations and assumptions. We go to great measures thinking we are being secure or proactive, but the reality is we put in very little effort in other aspects that may be more important and have a higher chance of a negative outcome.\n\nThe picture shows examples of measures that people take that are completely useless. A person painting a picture of a mountain range with the actual mountain range right in front of them, while wearing glasses, and then adding in a lake that isn't there and leaving out the one that is right in front of him.\n\nAnother example is the person who locks their bike up to a pole that a bike can easily be lifted off of, but doesn't put a lock on the wheels where it would actually need to be to prevent theft.\n\nLastly, the picture shows an example of someone assuming the power bank will rescue the dead phone, as many people would think. However, in this comic both devices are dead.",

    "20240101_181457.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because the person is asking if there is a power outlet, but the person they are asking is wearing a shirt that says \"yes, but\". This is funny because it plays on the words \"yes\" and \"but\" and implies that the person being asked is only willing to help if there is something in it for them.",
    "20240101_173729.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows two people in a car talking about how their farts smell good, but the fart shown in the image is depicted inside a heart-shaped balloon. The image implies that the couple's private fart-smelling ritual is an intimate and loving act. This is funny because it is unexpected and absurd.",
    "20240101_181343.jpg": " In the third image a question has been asked using images, which says \"If you put 4 bald men in a room with 3 combs, how many combs will each man have?\" which is funny/satirical because even if there are 3 combs and 4 men but the men are bald they won't use the combs and hence each man will have 0 combs.",
    "20240101_180626.jpg": " The last image is funny because the two people are arguing about which button to press on a TV remote even though both remotes shown do not have the button either of them are arguing about. ",
    "20240103_213052.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because even though fireplaces usually provide warmth and coziness, this house has a fireplace so large that it takes up a large portion of the wall and probably makes the room very hot. The irony is funny because normally people complain about fireplaces being too small.",
    "20240101_172400.jpg": " A: The image is making fun of how people will often say one thing but then immediately say something that directly contradicts the first thing that they said. Example 1, how a team will win the match but then are not given any of the prize money. Example 2, how someone will have over 1000 followers on social media but only follow a few hundred people back. Example 3 shows a green light for a cyclist, indicating that he may cross the intersection, but the red hand indicates that he may not. The cyclist is in a state of confusion (shown by his face) because of this. The image is funny because it is unexpected and it pokes fun at the very nature of contradictions.",
    "20240101_180335.jpg": " The image is trying to show the dissonance between what people say (in this case, how much they eat) and what they actually do (how much food they waste). The text in the image says \"Yes, but...\" which is a common phrase used to express this dissonance. In this case, the person wants to show how people say they don't waste food but are actually throwing away a lot by ordering too much food when eating out.",
    "20240101_180155.jpg": " The last image is funny/satirical because it's ironic how the camel can go through the eye of a needle but rich man cannot gain eternal life",
    "20240101_180754.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because in the first two examples, a man proficiently rows a boat despite not using the rowing machine in the gym whereas a woman calmly sips her coffee despite a nuclear explosion right outside the cafe but in the third example, the text is a plane ticket implying that the two in the previous example are probably a couple and the man wants to surprise his girlfriend so he booked a flight ticket to surprise her but she is not excited about it .",
    "20240101_172838.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it plays on the idea of how sizes are defined. We expect bigger sizes - M, L, XL, 2XL - to be bigger than S size. But here, the bigger sizes available for selection are actually smaller than S size.",
    "20240101_180032.jpg": " Because it shows satire on how people flaunt their lavish lifestyle and cars over social media platforms but in actually they are under heavy debts.",
    "20240101_173024.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because the man with tattoos on his arm is saying the phrase \"yes, but\" however only his tattooed arm is saying \"but\" while his non tattooed arm is saying \"yes\". This image is satirical because the two arms are having an argument by themselves on whether to say \"yes\" or \"no\" to the question posed in the third image.",
    "20240101_180927.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because The man looks at the woman with lust and his wife catches him.",
    "20240101_182328.jpg": " The third image is a play on words about the environmental impact of single-use items. The bag has the word \"eco\" printed on it to show that it's recyclable, but the bag is filled with single-use items. This is funny because it shows how people often try to be environmentally friendly, but they don't always follow through with their actions.",
    "20240101_182426.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows how in a typical office work environment, people work and utilize many computer applications, software, systems, and tools on their computer desktops and screens, but often do mundane or repetitive tasks.",
    "20240101_181054.jpg": " The image is trying to point out the hypocrisy of people who claim to be environmentally conscious but still use plastic water bottles. The image shows a water cooler with a sign that says \"yes, but\" next to it. There is also a plastic water bottle next to the cooler. The image is trying to convey the idea that it is not enough to just say that you are environmentally conscious; you also have to take action to reduce your impact on the environment.",
    "20240101_175759.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because The image is ironic because a person is making a to-do list while there is a grim reaper taking that person's soul away, ironically he will not complete his to-do list.",
    "20240101_173108.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it is ironic. The image shows a person standing on top of a foggy mountain, with the only path forward obscured by fog. Despite the lack of visibility, the person is taking a selfie, seemingly without a care in the world. This belies the fact that, as soon as they move forward, they may fall off a cliff, and yet they continue to act as though there is no danger and take a selfie as if to record their perilous state to share on social media as a display of bravery, despite it being foolhardy.",
    "20240101_175002.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it is making fun of the fact that many people bite their nails even after manicure.",
    "20240101_175541.jpg": " The image is part of a satire series named yes, but. It is funny/satirical because it questions the logic behind certain seemingly environment friendly actions. In this case, the person has put a board \"Save our Earth\" on his lawn. But the paint of the board is dripping into the lawn and harming the grass. Therefore, the board is urging people to save the Earth, but actually harming the earth himself.",
    "20240101_173532.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows how a celebrity is able to skip the line but a normal person is not allowed to.",
    "20240101_173647.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows a person trying to play a game on their Nintendo Switch. However, there is a message on the screen that says \"No Internet. The game does not work without internet. Close game\" which means that the person cannot play the game because they need to be connected to Wi-Fi. However, the person is still trying to play the game because they are bored on their road trip as shown by the road signs indicating road work which implies that there is a long traffic jam due to the road work. This is funny/satirical because it shows how some people are very persistent in trying to do something even when it is impossible.",
    "20240101_181146.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows how some people support their beliefs such as a \"pro gun\" stance but would not practice what they preach if the situation involved them being shot. This is seen in the image by the man wearing a shirt that promotes his \"pro-gun\" stance getting shot multiple times and him saying \"I am against gun violence but\".",
    "20240101_174055.jpg": " The image is funny because the man claims he has \"no problem\" with being verified on social media and yet the verification checkmark is being pulled out of him by a bunch of people. It is a satirical take on how some people crave for social media validation.",
    "20240101_180658.jpg": " The text in the image that says \"YES, BUT\" implies a contradiction. The last image shows a contradiction in the sizes of the straws and the drinks they are in.",
    "20240101_182249.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows that the expensive pen is secured by the relatively cheap zip-tie. While the pen costs US $2065, the zip-tie costs only a few cents, highlighting the fact that money is often spent on emphasizing form over substance.",
    "20240101_175259.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows a self-driving car with a father and a son in it. The father is happy to let the car drive itself, while the son is scared. Ironically, the car is taking them not to their destination but to a car showroom because, as the punchline suggests that the car wants to buy a human driver instead.",
    "20240101_175009.jpg": " The hat on the right is a top hat - a hat commonly worn by men. The top hat in the image contains a chess board pattern. There is a person wearing a hat, but only the lower part of the person's head is visible. Given that the person is wearing a top hat, we can conclude that the person is a gentleman. \n\nThe word \"checkmate\" in chess refers to a situation where the opponent's king is under attack and there is no way to escape. In the image, there is a chess board pattern on the top hat and the person wearing it has their face covered. This is symbolic of the saying \"checkmate\" as it is a situation where the person is cornered and cannot escape. \n\nThe text in the image reads \"Yes, but\" and this further adds to the humor of the image as it suggests that the top hat is a \"checkmate\" and there is no escape.",
    "20240101_181310.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows 2 people making the same point, but one of them gets blocked while the other doesn't, probably because of the reach of one of the accounts is greater than the other. \n\nWhile the first 2 panels are funny because of the contrast between the first response followed by the 'but' response, the third panel only says Yes, But at first, so the reader is probably wondering if the 'punchline' will come in the response to 'Yes, But'. However, there the reader is met with a message saying essentially that the satire has been flagged as 'hate speech', even though it's clearly not.",
    "20240101_181101.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows how much ladies eat in front of their friends and family but when they are alone they try to hide their eating habits.",
    "20240101_174225.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows a couple having dinner and they are talking over each other. This is a common occurrence in real life and it's funny because it's so relatable. The picture implies that even though they are together, they are in different worlds and not paying attention to each other as shown by their respective speech bubbles. The image is a humorous take on the struggles of communication in a relationship.",
    "20240101_182238.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows a person holding a phone with a lot of missed calls and messages, and the person is shown waiting in line at a customer service center. This is funny because it shows how people often ignore their phones when they are busy or don't want to talk to someone, but then they get frustrated when they have to wait in line for customer service.",
    "20240101_172731.jpg": " The third image is funny because it shows a juxtaposition of what people say they're going to do with their salad and what they actually do. A lot of people claim to like salad, or claim they will start eating salad to have a healthy diet, but this doesn't always happen. This is a commentary on the fact that people don't always follow through on their assertions or promises, or that it's a lot easier to say you're going to do something than to actually do it.",
    "20240101_173826.jpg": " Because the image is ironic. It shows that even though more information is available at our fingertips than ever before, people are becoming less informed and more narrow minded. They are not learning; they are not absorbing and considering different points of view and perspectives; they are not developing critical thinking skills. Consequently, they lack empathy to human suffering and have low standards for information and expertise.",
    "20240101_181128.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because It shows football player has missed all the goals.",
    "20240101_182638.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because of how it juxtaposes the words \"happy\" and \"chicken\". It is humorous because we can infer that the chicken on the right is not happy but is still being labeled as such because of how it is packaged.",
    "20240101_182357.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because in this image a person is shown who has only a pair of boxers on which is not covering his private parts completely. On top of that he has a jacket on which implies that he is trying to cover the fact that he is not wearing any pants but the jacket",
    "20240101_173141.jpg": " The third image is the man from the second image but his face has been swapped with a robot. It is funny because it is unexpected and absurd (and maybe a bit funny/satirical) to see a robot with tattoos on its exposed body parts in normal clothing. It is an image that is at once humorous and disturbing. The image plays with the idea of identity and what it means to be human by juxtaposing a robot and a human in such a way that they become interchangeable.",
    "20240101_182308.jpg": " The third image is funny because it shows a person trying to put on a small weight on a barbell, but they are struggling to do so.",

    "20240101_180851.jpg": " It is ironic because people are having a picnic with a basket and cheese and wine. There's a fly on the the cheese that seems to be saying yes but.",
    "20240101_174708.jpg": " The image is funny because it is unexpected and because there is a humorous play on words. First, the reader is shown a list of ingredients required to bake a strawberry cake. After \"sugar\" the list continues with an unusual ingredient for a cake: \"eggs strawberry\". Due to the comma after \"eggs\" it is clear that strawberry is an ingredient separate from eggs rather than an adjective to describe a specific kind of egg.  The reader may wonder how strawberries can be an ingredient in a cake and may try to guess what role they play. One would expect that strawberries might be mentioned again later in the recipe, perhaps as part of a strawberry frosting or filling.  However, the next frame of the comic shows dirty dishes piled in the sink, with water running and the caption \"BUT\". This is a humorous non-sequitur. There is no logical connection between the ingredients for the strawberry cake and a sink full of dirty dishes, nor is there any clear hint that the dirty dishes and water are related to the strawberries that were listed as an ingredient. It is only when the reader reaches the question at the bottom of the image that they understand the play-on-words: \"Eggs strawberry?\" The punchline is delivered when the reader realizes that \"eggs strawberry\"",
    "20240101_175602.jpg": " The third image is funny because it shows how even though many kitchen utensils are designed to make specific tasks easier, people still prefer to use other, more convenient methods. For example, the image shows how vegetable peelers are designed to peel vegetables, people still prefer to use knives, even though they are not as effective. Instead of using vegetable peeler for its intended purpose, a person is trying to peel ginger using it, which is not practical and funny.",
    "20240101_175031.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because The image is ironical, because in the first image a gun is shown, that is purposed to shoot money but in the second image it is shown that those robbed the money are enjoying and not bothered.",
    "20240101_172351.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because It's ironic how people will go to a buffet and eat until they're stuffed, but when it's time to cook they only make enough food for one person.",
    "20240101_172348.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows a man putting a star on a Christmas tree but is struggling to do so. The images are funny since it shows how men act tough  but can't do all the things they say they can do. It is poking fun at the gender roles that exist in our society and shows that sometimes men act incompetent.",
    "20240101_174757.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because the cafe's name is Yes, But. The person in the image is sitting in the cafe and smoking next to a no smoking sign. This is likely a subtle nod to the cafe's name, with the person thinking 'Yes, but I am the exception to the rule'.",
    "20240101_173010.jpg": " It says \u2018$54.99\u2019 but costs $120. This is funny because it is sarcastic. It\u2019s like when you see a really low price, but then you realize there\u2019s a hidden fee or something. It makes fun of that kind of situation.",
    "20240101_173921.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it is ironic. In the first two images, we see examples of yes, but actually no. In this third image, we see a third option in response to a yes or no question: yes, but yes. This is unexpected and humorous.",
    "20240101_173552.jpg": " In the first two examples \"Yes\" means that something is true but in the \"But\" part the shown images are not in accordance with the \"Yes\" meaning. The viewer is expected to think that the images in \"But\" parts are the results of the \"Yes\" which are actually not. This creates a humorous effect. In the third image, it shows the coffee is hot with the smoke curling up but the person in the image blows it in the opposite direction of where the smoke is going in the first place which is illogical.",
    "20240101_172339.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because humans have a saying \"yes, but\", which shows a bit of reluctance after agreeing to do something, which is what is shown in the image.",
    "20240101_180802.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because the person is carrying a very small dog. Usually small dogs are carried in bags or on the hands, but in this image, the dog is on a leash being led by its owner, like it was a large dog. This is funny/satirical because of the absurdity of it.",
    "20240101_180037.jpg": " The third image is funny because it shows a beautiful sunset with clouds but with lots of high tension wires in the way, spoiling the beauty of the sunset. This brings a sarcastic or comedic effect with the caption saying \"Yes, but\".",
    "20240101_174119.jpg": " The image shows some sort of disco party or loud music event with a baby right next to the speakers. It is funny because it shows that babies can't decide for themselves to leave a place that has loud music and therefore the parents should decide where to take their baby. Or it can mean that babies decide where their parents take them by crying.",
    "20240101_172412.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because The image is funny because it is ironic since the woman is wearing a pro-abortion shirt that says \"Abortion is cool\" and holding a baby.",
    "20240101_172936.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows how people are concerned about privacy and are willing to put tape over their laptop's camera to prevent it from being hacked. However, they fail to realize that their smartphone has a camera that is always on and can be used to track them just as easily.",
    "20240101_182413.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it plays on the contrast between the highbrow and the lowbrow. The first two images are of women engaged in refined activities. The first image is of a woman painting a beautiful landscape and the second image is of a woman watching a ballet performance. The third image is different in that it is of a woman with a very casual outfit and she is sleeping in the theatre while a ballet is being performed. This contrast is humorous because it shows that even though the first two women are engaged in more refined activities, they are not necessarily any better than the woman in the third image. In fact, the woman in the third image may be having more fun than the other two women.",
    "20240101_182252.jpg": " It has the word 'vegan', which means the person does not consume any animal products, but the 'but' shows a different scenario where the so-called vegan is seen experimenting with animal testing, which is contradictory to being a vegan.",
    "20240101_174853.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows how we often see things in a positive light, but when we look more closely we see the negative aspects. The image shows a carton of milk with the text \"yes, but\" on it. Initially, one might think that the carton is sealed indicating that the milk is okay to drink, but on closer examination, one realizes that the seal has not been applied correctly and it could be opened. This can be linked to how sometimes we make assumptions about things without looking closely enough at the details. It shows how what we see is often not the reality.",
    "20240101_175531.jpg": " The image is funny/satirical because it is ironic.\n\nThe question says \"If you don't want to wet the toilet seat... use tissues, BUT...\" and we are supposed to answer with something absurd. It shows a tissue pack with a label \"Do not use to wipe your butt\" along with instructions on the pack that say \"To be used only to wipe tears\". So the answer is \"you can still use it to wipe your butt\".",
    "20240101_180643.jpg": " The third image is ironic because The person has a lot of money, but they are playing a board game, as if they can't afford leisure activities.",

    "20240101_173054.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows the juxtaposition between a person's appearance and their beliefs. In this case, the person has \"anti-capitalist\" written on their shirt, but then they appear to be working at a job that is part of the capitalist system. This creates a humorous contrast between the person's beliefs and their actions.",
    "20240101_172325.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because just as in the first and second examples where there is something that might seem like the perfect solution to a problem, but in reality just create more problems. In this case, the \"Bird trap for outdoor cats\" is supposed to prevent outdoor cats from entering into your garden, but the solution shown is just a picture of a fake bird inside a trap, which would obviously not prevent any real birds and cats to enter the garden. In fact, cats might be even more attracted to the garden if they see a fake bird there since they would think it's an actual bird that they can hunt. So, the solution presented is not really a solution at all since it doesn't solve the problem and might even make the problem worse.",
    "20240101_181009.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows the irony of how people are more concerned about creating strong passwords than they are about protecting their skin from the sun. This is evident from the fact that the password field is labeled as \"Strong\" while the \"Yes, BUT\" label is placed beside it, however, the \"Agree to the Terms & Conditions\" checkbox is not checked, which is a much more serious issue. Also, it says \"Forgot Password?\" next to the password field, which further highlights the irony that people don't care much about their skin protection while being overly concerned about forgetting their passwords.",

    "20240101_181415.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because The image is trying to highlight the ridiculousness of nutritional information on food packaging. The front of the package states that the cookies have 160 calories per serving, but the back of the package states that there are 3 servings per cookie. This means that the entire cookie has 480 calories, not 160 calories as stated on the front of the package.

The image draws a parallel between prohibition-era speakeasies and the current vaping trend.

    "20240101_172350.jpg": " The third image is a question that relates to the two examples before it. The two examples are YES and BUT scenarios. Where the first image shows a man who looks like he has cancer or some disease, therefore being sad, but is happy in the swimming pool because he does not have to wear a swimming cap. The second image shows a woman who is trying to eat with chopsticks, but she is not very good at it. She might be trying to look sophisticated by using chopsticks, but she is actually making a mess. The third image is trying to pose a similar situation in the same format. So, the image shows a person using their hand to eat noodles or soup with the text saying \"slurp\" next to it. This eating style is generally considered rude in many cultures; however, in some cultures, such as certain parts of Asia, slurping your noodles is considered to be a sign of enjoyment, appreciation, and a way to cool down the noodles. The image is trying to show an example of a \"YES\" and \"BUT\" like the examples before it. With this image, it is \"YES\" it is more efficient to use your hands and slurp your noodles; \"BUT\" it is considered rude in many cultures.",
    "20240101_173017.jpg": " It's because the image shows how people often say nice and sweet words to others while texting but in real life when they actually meet the other person they don't express the same feelings as they did while texting.",

The text written on the salad bowl says 'Yes, but' and the bottle that is being poured over the salad says 'Mayonnaise'. It is ironic and funny because we try to deceive our minds by eating the healthy food but end up consuming it with unhealthy things which makes it unhealthy. The image is a satire on the diet industry and the way we think about food. We try to make healthier choices, but we are not willing to give up the unhealthy things that we love. This salad is a perfect example of this hypocrisy. It is made with healthy, organic ingredients, but it is drowned in mayonnaise. This makes it just as unhealthy as any other salad. The image is a reminder that we need to be honest with ourselves about what we are eating. We can't just make a few small changes and expect to see results. We need to be committed to making a healthy lifestyle change.",

The word \"investing\" is often used to describe the process of putting money into a financial instrument with the expectation of earning a profit. However, the message is using the word \"investing\" to describe the process of spending money on things that are not necessary. This is a funny play on words because it is unexpected.

This is a satirical take on how people are disconnected from the reality of the meat industry and the conditions in which animals are raised.",
    "20240101_180545.jpg": " It is ironic because the text says \"yes vegan\" showing a smiley happy face, and \"but\" showing a frown sad face. This implies vegans are usually happy and non-vegans are sad. However, the non-vegan's mouth has lettuce stuck in it which could indicate the cause of his sadness. This is funny because the cause of the non-vegan's sadness is a vegan food and thus the vegan is happy because he isn't the one with a problem.",

However the second panel shows a woman sitting next to the chair, taking a selfie in front of the mirror. This isn't the normal use case for a chair, and is funny because the woman could be sitting in the chair as it's intended, but she choses not to. This is satire because it shows how people these days are more focused on taking selfies and how some people have become way too indulged into using social media, in this case that has caused for the person taking a selfie to be sitting by the sink taking a selfie using a mirror, while not using a chair that is actually meant for sitting on.",

    "20240101_180247.jpg": " The image is funny because in the first two examples, the \"Yes\" part of the image is an \"easy\" or \"simple\" task while the \"But\" part of the example shows how the reality is more complicated and difficult. In the first example, the \"Yes\" part is a woman shopping with a basket, which is an easy task that most people will have no problem doing. However, the \"But\" part shows the reality that shopping is often made more difficult by the fact that people will have a lot of items to carry and will have to pay for them. In the second example, the \"Yes\" part is moving furniture into a house, which is also an easy task that most people will have no problem doing. However, the \"But\" part shows the reality that moving furniture is often made more difficult by the fact that it is heavy and awkward, and can damage the house.\n\nThe third example is funny because it follows the same pattern as the first two examples, with the first part being an \"easy\" task and the second part being a more difficult and complicated reality. However, this example is funny because the second part is completely outlandish and ridiculous, as it is not a common occurrence for a person to fall asleep",

    "20240101_173326.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows a woman struggling to remember her exes' names. This is funny and relatable because it is difficult to remember the names of people you have dated, especially if you have dated many people. It implies that men tend to forget the names of women they have been with, more than women tend to forget the names of men they have been with. This is perhaps because men are more likely to be the ones to initiate relationships and to move on from them more quickly.",

    "20240101_175126.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it is unexpected and absurd when in the first image in 'YES' section a person is seen entering a Halloween party in a unique costume but in the 'BUT' section when the same person removes the mask, he is seen wearing the a very common costume same as many people in the party which is unexpected and funny.",
    "20240101_175135.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows how easily the \"Yes, but\" response can be used to derail a conversation and prevent any actual progress from being made. On the other hand men also get bullied through memes but no one says stop bullying men.",

    "20240101_175554.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows a contradiction between the words \"yes\" and \"but\". The image shows a door which has \"Pull\" written on it, suggesting that one should pull the door to open it. However, the door is actually opened by pushing it. This is funny/satirical because it shows that the words \"yes\" and \"but\" can have different meanings in different contexts.",
    "20240101_180758.jpg": " The third image is also a satire because it shows how cats want to explore and go out but they just want to stay home and be lazy.

The ironic part is that the black car is breaking the rule by crossing the line whereas the word yes is used in a positive manner and yellow car is following the rules whereas the word but is used in a negative manner defying the set societal norms.",

    "20240101_174147.jpg": " The third image is funny/satirical because it shows how social media is full of people saying \"yes, but\" all the time without really contributing to the conversation or offering any value. This can be seen in the example given, where one person says \"No to this!! Stop bullying women!\", and the other person responds with \"Yes, but\".

When put together the two words/objects form the phrase \"yes, but\". This is the same phrase that has been used in the previous two examples, however, in those examples it made sense. In this example the phrase is nonsensical. It is funny because it is unexpected and doesn't make sense.",

    "20240101_173112.jpg": " The last image is a satire on how some people are so obsessed with taking selfies that they are willing to risk their own lives for the perfect shot. The image is especially funny because the man is taking a selfie of himself standing on top of a skyscraper with his back to the edge. This is a very dangerous position to be in, and the man is clearly risking his life for the sake of a selfie. It is also funny that the image is captioned \"How to take a selfie\", as if this is a normal thing to do.\n\nThis image is a great example of how satire can be used to make a point about a serious issue.

    "20240101_173638.jpg": " The image is funny because it's an absurd comparison. There is a big muscular man with a bunch of protein powder saying \"Whey Protein... yummy yummy\". Since the man has large muscles, it implies it is difficult for him to eat \"yummy\" foods and yet he is shown with child-like protein powders that say \"yummy yummy\" and \"teddy\". It is funny because it is a juxtaposition of the protein powder typically associated with body builders and the child-like flavors available.",
