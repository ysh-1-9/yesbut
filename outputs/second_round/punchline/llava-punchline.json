    "20240101_173341_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The punchline in this meme is the image of a shoe with a heart on the sole and the image of a person's foot with a heart on their big toe. The humor comes from the comparison of the shoe and the person's foot, both having hearts on them, but the shoe is an inanimate object, while the person's foot represents a living being. The contrast between the two creates a humorous and playful visual."
