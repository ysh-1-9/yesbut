The sky is clear, and everything is perfect. \n\nThe \"but\" picture is a more realistic depiction of the world. It shows a tangled mess of electrical wires and a setting sun. The sky looks cloudy and dreary. \n\nThe contrast between the two pictures is humorous because it shows how our expectations of life are often very different from the reality.",
    "20240101_181411_STICK_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline in this meme is the saying \"Yes, but\". The picture shows a bunch of people with different hair colors, with one man at the top with blue hair. The meme is saying how society is more accepting now, but there are still some hold outs. Like the man with the blue hair is the only one that is different.",
    "20240101_174757_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The punchline in this meme is that even though the woman in the cafe is enjoying her surroundings, she will still have to deal with the mushroom cloud behind her, which is a metaphor for problems.",

    "20240101_173144_STICK_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is \"Takes the stairs\". It is funny because in the left panel she is working hard on the treadmill but then in the right panel she takes the stairs instead of using the elevator. It is hypocritical because she appeared to put in the work to get in shape but then does not follow through.",
    "20240101_173245_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that in the first panel, a card that says \"Dreams Come True\" is shown. In the second panel, a paper clip is holding money. The implication is that money is the only thing that will make dreams come true.",
    "20240101_182252_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline of the meme is that even though the person in the meme is a vegan, they still got a tattoo, which requires the use of ink that is not vegan.",
    "20240101_182511_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that the man in the picture is a hipster, and hipsters are often seen as being pretentious and full of themselves.

    "20240101_181143_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The first panel of the meme shows cars parked in a circle, with the caption, \"YES.\" The second panel of the meme shows a similar parking lot, with a single car parked in the middle. The caption says, \"BUT.\" The punchline of the meme is that the first panel is an unrealistic representation of how people park cars, while the second panel is a more realistic representation.",
    "20240101_175413_STICK_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline of this meme is that even though the pie chart on the left is visually appealing, it is not very useful since there is no way to tell what the data represents. The pie chart on the right is much simpler, but it is also much more informative.",
    "20240101_174540_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The meme is a play on the popular \"Yes, but\" meme. In this version, the image on the right shows a boxer who has been badly beaten. He is missing teeth and has a black eye. The caption on the left says \"Yes,\" and the caption on the right says \"But.\" The implication is that the boxer won the fight, but he paid a high price for his victory.",
    "20240101_173308_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The punchline in this meme is the juxtaposition of the products in the left column (skincare) and the products in the right column (cigarettes and energy drinks). The skincare products are all about making you look younger and more beautiful, while the cigarettes and energy drinks are all about giving you a quick fix. The meme is playing on the idea that people are often willing to spend money on things that will make them look younger, but they're not willing to give up the things that are actually bad for them.",
    "20240101_175722_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline of this meme lies in the contrast between the two images. On the left, we are shown a Muslim woman in a hijab assisting a man in receiving an injection. The woman is dressed modestly, with her face covered. On the right, we see a close-up of a gloved hand holding a syringe filled with a red liquid. The syringe is about to be injected into the arm of an unseen person.\n\nThe meme's humor derives from the juxtaposition of these two images. On one hand, we have a very serious medical procedure being carried out. On the other hand, we have a seemingly innocuous",
    "20240101_181009_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The punchline in this meme is that even though the password is strong, the user will still forget it. This is because humans are forgetful creatures. We often forget things like our passwords, our phone numbers, and our anniversaries. This meme is a reminder that even though we try to make our passwords strong, we will still forget them.",
    "20240101_175126_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The first panel of the meme is a picture of a latte with a beautiful design made in the foam on top. The second panel is a picture of a latte with all the foam stirred in. The text at the top of the first panel says \"Yes\" and the text at the top of the second panel says \"But.\" \n\nThe punchline is that the first panel of the meme is an idealized  version of a latte, while the second panel is a more realistic depiction of what happens when you actually stir your latte.",

    "20240101_180335_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is the contrast between two images. The first image shows a woman eating food politely at a table while the second image shows a woman in a hijab spilling her food. The caption for the first image is \"Yes\" and the caption for the second image is \"But\". This suggests that the woman in the hijab is not as refined or polite as the woman in the first image. This meme is likely intended to be humorous and should not be taken too seriously.",

The implication is that it is much easier to make music with a synthesizer than with traditional instruments.",
    "20240101_173039_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that the left side of the picture says \"YES\", and the right side says \"BUT\". This is a play on the phrase \"yes, but\". The phrase \"yes, but\" is often used when someone agrees with something in theory, but then immediately follows it up with a reason why they can't actually do it. This meme is a play on this phrase, and it's funny because it's so true. We often find ourselves saying \"yes, but\" when we really don't want to do something.",

    "20240101_180758_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that it is possible for something to be both \"yes\" and \"but\" at the same time. The image shows a spool of rope and a cat on a couch. The caption \"Yes, but\" suggests that the answer to a question or request is both yes (the spool of rope) and but (the cat on the couch).  The meme is funny because it plays on the idea of a cat being both cute and a little bit naughty. It's a lighthearted way to poke fun at cats.",

In the second panel, there is a free Wi-Fi sign and everyone wants to connect to it. So it is satirizing the fact that people nowadays prefer Wi-Fi over human connection.",
    "20240101_174518_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that the man is not free even though he is not in a cage, because he is still chained to the TV. This is a commentary on how people can be addicted to technology and social media, and how this addiction can prevent them from living their lives to the fullest and enjoying the world around them. The elephant in the room is the issue of addiction, which the man is trying to ignore by watching TV.",
    "20240101_172325_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that the bird on the right is saying \"yes, but\" which is a phrase that is often used to express agreement with a condition or reservation. The bird on the left is responding to the bird on the right's statement by saying \"okay, I guess\", which is a phrase that is often used to express that one is not entirely convinced or satisfied with the conditions or reservations that have been presented.",
    "20240101_175353_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline of the meme is that the first image shows someone standing in a room looking out at the beach and the second image shows a giant wave coming in about to hit the room.  The first image could be seen as a positive outlook as someone seeing a beautiful beach from their window but the second image shows that the view isn't all it's cracked up to be. This is likely in reference to how the news and media can often show us a skewed version of reality and we have to look deeper to get the full picture.",
    "20240101_175836_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that a lot of people want to see your resume, but when you call an unknown number, you don't want to answer it.",
    "20240101_174029_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is \"yes, but\". This is a common phrase used to express agreement with a statement, but also to add a condition or reservation. In this meme, the first panel shows a woman holding a carrot and a child reaching for it. The second panel shows a rabbit crying while black tar-like tears drip from its eyes. The implication is that the child's desire for the carrot has caused the rabbit to be harmed. The meme is humorous because it plays on the phrase \"yes, but\" and the idea that our desires can have unintended consequences.",
    "20240101_173159_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that the first panel is labeled \"Yes,\" which is what the trash can would say. Then the second panel shows a piece of gum being stuck to a fence, and the fence is labeled \"But,\" which is an adversative meaning \"on the contrary.\" So the meme is playing off of the idea that the fence is saying \"But\" in response to the trash can saying \"Yes.\" This is funny because it's unexpected and because it's a clever play on words.",
    "20240101_180751_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that even though the salad is healthy, adding mayonnaise makes it unhealthy.",
    "20240101_173039_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The meme is referencing the stereotype that gay men are always trying to turn straight men gay. In the first panel, the straight man is being objectified by the crowd, and in the second panel, the gay men are holding hands in front of him, implying that they are \"turning\" him. The punchline is that the straight man is not actually interested in the gay men, but is instead trying to get the attention of the crowd.",
    "20240101_180601_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline of this meme is that the glass is half empty, but the person is still drinking from it. This is meant to be humorous because it shows that the person is optimistic, even though the glass is half empty.",

    "20240101_173542_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline of this meme is that it shows how different perspectives can lead to very different conclusions. The first image shows a sign that says \"Secret Beach\" with an arrow pointing to the right. The second image shows a beach full of people. The implication is that the first image is from the perspective of someone who is looking for a secluded beach, while the second image is from the perspective of someone who is looking for a crowded beach.",
    "20240101_181128_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline in this meme is meant to highlight the disconnect between a person's expectations and reality. The person has taken off his shirt to reveal a shirt that says \"God is Great\" underneath, implying that he expects God to help him win the game. However, the scoreboard shows that his team is losing 0-3, indicating that God is not helping him win. This creates a humorous contrast between the person's expectations and the reality of the situation.",
    "20240101_174927_ORIG_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline in this meme is the second panel, which shows a person sitting on a toilet taking a selfie. This is unexpected and humorous because it is not a typical place to take a selfie.",

The second image shows a water cooler with a sign on it that says \u201cFight Club\u201d. The punchline is that the first image is a reference to the movie Fight Club, in which the main character, Tyler Durden, says \u201cWe buy things we don\u2019t need with money we don\u2019t have to impress people we don\u2019t like\u201d.

    "20240101_173043_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The punchline of this meme is that diet soda has a lot of sugar in it. The picture shows a can of diet soda with a picture of french fries on it. The can is labeled \"diet\" but the fries are not. This is a common joke about diet soda, that it is not actually good for you despite being marketed as such.",
    "20240101_173007_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that saying \"yes, but\" is a way of saying no. In the first panel, the people are all gathered together under one umbrella. This represents the idea of saying \"yes.\" In the second panel, the people are all scattered under different umbrellas. This represents the idea of saying \"yes, but.\" The implication is that when you say \"yes, but,\" you are actually saying no.",

This implies that the woman in the second panel is enjoying her coffee as well.",

The meme is playing off of the common complaint that people have about 2D images of rooms, which is that they don't accurately represent the depth and size of the room. The meme is also poking fun at the fact that people will often say \"yes\" to something, but then follow it up with a \"but,\" which suggests that they don't actually mean what they said. In this case, the person is saying \"yes\" to the idea",
    "20240101_180548_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The word \"but\" in the meme is a homophone for the word \"butt.\" The image shows a person with a head shaped like a butt. The combination of the words \"think twice\" and the butt-shaped head creates a visual pun that suggests the human head is a butt.",
    "20240101_174949_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that the dog has a shoe in its mouth. The dog is black and the toys are also black. The only thing that is not black is the shoe. The shoe being the odd one out is the punchline.",

    "20240101_180037_STICK_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that the second image, though it is ominous, is actually a picture of clouds. \nThis is unexpected because the first image is clearly meant to represent clouds, while the second image at first seems to be something completely unrelated.\n\nThere is also the implied \"Yes, but\" to the question \"Are these pictures the same?\"\nThis is funny because the first image is clearly meant to represent clouds, while the second image at first seems to be something completely unrelated.",

The second panel of the meme shows the boxer who lost with a black eye. The implication is that the boxer who lost is saying \"yes, but\" to the referee's decision. This is funny because the boxer who lost is clearly not in a position to argue with the referee.",

The man on the right is riding the elephant as if he owns it and is not concerned about where he is going or what the elephant is doing. \n\nYou can interpret the punchline in different ways, but one way is that the meme criticizes those who are quick to point out flaws in others (the man looking at the elephant in the cage) rather than focusing on their own (the",

The adapter is shaped in a way that although it looks like it shouldn't work, it does. The appliance still gets power through the 2 prongs and the 3rd prong of the outlet is unused.",
    "20240101_174927_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline of the meme is that the chair is not sitting on a shadow, the shadow is sitting on the chair.  It is funny because it is unexpected and because it plays on the word \"yes\" to show how even though the statement is technically true, it is not what a person would normally expect when hearing the word \"yes\".",
    "20240101_180947_STICK_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline in this meme is that the second panel is a picture of a handicapped spot with a car parked in it. The \"BUT\" implies that while handicapped parking exists, some people still park in them without being handicapped.",

This suggests that the waiter is about to serve the meal to someone. However, the words 'but' appear next to the plate of food, suggesting that there is something wrong with the meal.\n\nThis contrast between 'yes' and 'but' creates a humorous effect, as it suggests that the waiter is about to serve a meal that is not very good.",

The second panel shows a black and white photo of a person pouring ranch dressing on a salad with the word \u201cBUT\u201d above it. The punchline is that the salad in the second panel is much less healthy than the salad in the first panel. The ranch dressing is high in calories and fat, and it can also contain added sugar.

    "20240101_174757_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that women can't decide what they want, and also that they are responsible for the destruction of the world. This is funny because it plays on the stereotype that women are indecisive and that they are always changing their minds. It is also funny because it is so unexpected. The first panel of the meme shows a woman sitting at her desk, drinking coffee and looking at her laptop. She is smiling and seems to be enjoying herself.

This is funny because it is an example of how something can be true in theory but not in practice. In this case, the bike is technically available for use, but it is not actually usable because it is covered in clothes.",

The second occurrence of the word \"Think\" is accompanied by a portrait of a man with a lot of piercings and tattoos on his face, and the word \"Twice\" is tattooed on the man's neck. The punchline of the meme is that the man has taken the idiom \"Think twice\" literally, which is absurd and funny because piercings and tattoos are permanent and cannot be undone.",

This image is a metaphor for cat furniture.\n\nThe second image is of a cartoon cat scratching a pink couch. The cat is using the couch as a scratching post, which is a common behavior for cats.\n\nThe juxtaposition of these two images serves to highlight the absurdity of the fact that cats will often destroy furniture, even when they have perfectly good cat furniture available to them.

The caption, \"Yes, but\" suggests that the second image is the reality behind the first image. In other words, the meme is saying that the beautiful sunset is not as it seems and that there is a hidden reality that is not so beautiful.\n\nThis meme is funny because it plays on our expectations. We expect the second image to be a beautiful sunset like the first image but are instead met with a tangled mess of wires and cables. This unexpected twist is what makes the",

    "20240101_173039_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline of the meme is the juxtaposition between the large crowd of women who are cheering for the man on stage and the two men in the second panel, one of whom is holding the other's hand. The implication is that while the women are attracted to and cheering for the man on stage, the two men are interested in each other. This is reinforced by the text in the first panel, which says \"Yes,\" and the text in the second panel, which says \"But.\" The meme is humorous because it suggests that the two men are not interested in the women who are cheering for the man on stage. Instead,",

    "20240101_173642 (1)_ORIG_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline in this meme is that women are often expected to do more than men, even when they are already doing a lot. The woman in the meme is shown carrying a heavy basket of groceries, while the man is shown standing next to her with an empty basket. This suggests that the woman is doing more than her fair share of the work. The caption on the left, \"yes,\" indicates that the woman is doing a good job, but the caption on the right, \"but,\" indicates that there is still more that she needs to do. This meme highlights the unrealistic expectations that are often placed on women.",
    "20240101_181054_STICK_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is the juxtaposition of the two images. The image on the left shows a person yelling with a caption that says \"yes\", and the image on the right shows a person enjoying music in a car with a caption that says \"but\". This suggests that the person in the first image is hypocritical because they are telling someone not to do something that they themselves are doing.

    "20240101_173642 (1)_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that people often use the phrase \"yes, but\" to express their agreement with a statement while also expressing a reservation or objection. The meme illustrates this by showing a woman carrying a heavy basket labeled \"yes\" and a teapot labeled \"but.\" The woman is struggling to carry the basket and the teapot, which suggests that the \"but\" is a heavy burden for her to bear. This is funny because it's relatable. How often do we all agree to something we know will be a burden?",

The two images are contrasted with the text \"Yes\" and \"But\" respectively, implying that the minimalist drawing is simple and easy to understand, while the 3D rendering is more complex and difficult to understand. This is funny because it plays on the idea that minimalist art is often seen as being pretentious and overly simplistic, while more complex and detailed works of art are seen as being more impressive and meaningful.",

    "20240101_180548_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": " The word 'Think' is written in small letters, while the word 'Twice' is written in big letters on the left side image. This implies that the word 'think' is not as important as the word 'twice'. This is conveyed in a sarcastic manner since the words are reversed on the right side image, where the word 'Think' is written in big letters and the word 'twice' is written in small letters. This reversal of the words conveys the idea that the person in the picture should have thought twice before getting the tattoo. The small letters of the word 'think' on the left also imply that the person",

The meme is funny because it shows how something that seems harmless (the tattoo) can actually be dangerous (the snake). It is a visual representation of the phrase \"yes, but.\"",
    "20240101_173003_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline in this meme is that the second panel of the meme contradicts the first panel. The first panel says \"Yes,\" and the second panel says \"But.\" This is funny because the second panel is the opposite of what the first panel says.",

This is seen as a contradiction by the creator of the meme.",
    "20240101_172838_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is that the shirt says \"nonbinary\" but the options to choose are \"male\" and \"female\". This creates a humorous juxtaposition and highlights the absurdity of gender binary options.",
    "20240101_174737_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The woman sitting by the window is thinking that even though she has a laptop and a fancy drink, her life is boring and unfulfilling.

    "20240101_182526_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " The punchline is based on a common misconception that \"Yes\" is a male name and \"But\" is a female name. \nThis is a meme playing off the common stereotypes of men and women.

    "20240101_182638_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": " The punchline of the meme is the contrast between the words \"happy chicken\" and the image of a chicken in pain. The words \"happy chicken\" are written in a cheerful, playful font, and the chicken is illustrated in a cute, cartoonish style.

This is meant to be humorous, as it highlights the absurdity of the claim that chickens are happy when they are being raised for food.",
