On the right side, labeled \"BUT,\" there's a photograph of an actual urban setting with tangled power lines against a backdrop of the sky, which disrupts the idealized image.

The left panel shows a single stylized person with a blue splash on their head, while the right panel shows several individuals in a choir format with various colors splashed on their heads. The joke here appears to be a play on the phrase \"Yes, but...\" which is commonly used to acknowledge a point before bringing up exceptions or objections. The humorous twist lies in the visual pun where \"but\" is visually represented by multiple \"butts\" (represented by the choir of individuals) instead of the conjunction \"but\".",

On the right, the contrasting \"BUT\" panel depicts a person nonchalantly sipping coffee while a mushroom cloud from a nuclear explosion is visible outside the window, which humorously highlights a dire situation being ignored or taken with surprising calmness. The punchline of this meme often plays on the discrepancy between an expected, calm situation versus an outrageous or alarming background event, implying an ironic or inexplicable disregard for the seriousness of the situation.",

On the right, the word \"BUT\" is seen, and the corresponding picture humorously depicts a bed with a human-shaped indentation in the middle, implying that the person has simply covered the unmade bed with a blanket without properly making it.

The right side displays a silhouette of a woman choosing to take an elevator instead of the stairs, suggesting a choice for convenience over extra physical effort. The humor in the meme comes from the contrast between the two actions: exercising with purpose versus avoiding a small opportunity for exercise in daily life.

However, the second panel shows a sign that reads \"3D OFFSIDE,\" with the word \"BUT,\" suggesting a surprising and overly complex reason that the goal would not count.

The punchline comes with the \"BUT\" where it shows the available sizes for the shoe, with all common sizes being sold out, leaving only the very small and very large sizes available.

The right panel shows the same woman riding a scooter, seemingly contradicting the precautionary action of applying sunscreen, as her posture exposes her skin to the sun which can lead to sunburn, therefore humorously negating her earlier action.

The right image humorously counters this by showing a group of crows creating a mess on top of parked cars, a common yet frustrating occurrence for car owners, accompanied by the word \"but,\" suggesting a contrasting, less desirable, or problematic situation.

In the first panel, there's a person turning on a large faucet connected to a small bathtub, which seems impractical, while in the second panel, a person is struggling to use a small, very low faucet to get water while in the shower, which is comically inconvenient. The punchline of the meme lies in the contrast between the expected and actual functionality showcased in the two situations. Despite having the means (a large faucet in the first panel), the setting isn't practical, and when something practical is needed (a normal shower in",

On the right side, the word \"BUT\" is followed by an illustration of a person surrounded by several remote controls, looking confused with question marks above their head. The punchline is humorous because it plays on the expected continuation of a serious message after \"YES,\" only to present a trivial and relatable problem\u2014dealing with too many remote controls\u2014after \"BUT.\" This juxtaposition exaggerates the minor inconvenience to the level of a significant issue, which is a common",

However, in the second panel labeled \"BUT,\" the same slim phone is awkwardly attached to a bulky portable charger, which humorously negates the advantage of the phone's slimness while charging on the go. The punchline of the meme is the irony that the phone, while slim, loses its sleek advantage when it needs to be charged with an external battery pack, which is typically not as slim.",

The right panel shows a humorously contrasted image of a woman riding a scooter, looking disheveled by the wind, which presumably would negate the effort of applying perfume as depicted in the left panel.

The \"BUT\" panel shows an impossibly long and straight road with many obstacles, represented by deep potholes.

The second panel contradicts the first with a picture of a person\u2019s arms cradling an assortment of items without a basket, accompanied by the caption \"BUT.\" The joke lies in the depiction of a common experience where someone might think they only need a few items and don't take a basket, but ends up picking more items than they can comfortably carry.

On the right, the word \"BUT\" introduces a contrasting scene with a plate of food being swarmed by flies, illustrating a common drawback of picnics \u2014 the nuisance of insects.

The punchline of the meme is conveyed through the captions \"YES,\" next to the image of a hand holding one remote control aimed at a TV, then \"BUT\" above the confused person surrounded by many remotes. The humor arises from the juxtaposition of the simplicity of using just one remote control to operate a device, with the all-too-common and relatable situation of having an overwhelming number of remote controls, each potentially for different devices, which can lead to confusion and frustration.",

This format is often used to highlight everyday situations or experiences that don't meet our expectations.

On the right, the image suggests the reality or a drawback with \"BUT,\" showing a person in the bathtub being exposed through large windows to the outside, potentially compromising privacy.

The left panel shows an artful room with an open door leading to the ocean, which resembles a common motivational or idealistic scenario, indicating a positive perspective or the word \"yes.\" The right panel, however, humorously juxtaposes this by depicting a giant hand poised to flick a building into the water, representing a more cynical or undermining twist on the situation, indicated by the word \"but.\" The punchline lies in the contrast between the idyllic scenario and the impending, humorous disaster",
    "20240101_182531_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": "The meme is a play on the concept of ultra-slim smartphones. On the left side, a hand is holding a phone with the text \"ULTRA SLIM\" displayed on its screen, signifying the sleek and thin design of modern phones. On the right side, however, the same phone is connected to a bulky external battery, suggesting that while the phone itself is very thin, it requires an additional, much thicker battery to maintain a practical battery life, which contradicts the convenience of its slimness. The words \"YES,\" and \"BUT\" serve to humorously contrast the initial selling point of the phone with the practical",
    "20240101_182625_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The meme you're referring to displays a humorous contrast between two images. On the left, there is a snow globe with a miniature cityscape labeled \"NEW YORK,\" and on the right, there's a close-up of a label on the bottom of the globe that says \"MADE IN CHINA.\" The punchline of the meme is the juxtaposition of the iconic New York City, typically associated with American culture and commodities, being manufactured in China, highlighting the global nature of production and commerce where goods associated with one country are often produced in another.",
    "20240101_173605_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The meme presents a humorous comparison. On the left, there's an image of a cactus with a sign that says \"FREE HUGS,\" which is a play on the idea that nobody would want to hug a cactus because it is prickly and would hurt. On the right, there's an illustration of individuals being lured towards a sign that says \"FREE WIFI,\" despite the sign being attached to a large, menacing spider. The joke is that while people might avoid free hugs from a cactus, they are so drawn to free Wi-Fi that they would ignore the danger of the spider, satirizing our society's",
    "20240101_175738_STICK_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": "The meme features two contrasting images. In the first image, there's a man appearing to celebrate in front of a computer showing a graph with an upward trend, along with the text \"YES,\" which implies a positive situation or outcome.\n\nIn the second image, there's a three-dimensional graph with a sharp decline, and the word \"BUT\" which implies that there's a significant downside or negative turn following the initial positive impression.\n\nThe meme's punchline is a play on the concept of expectation versus reality or a sudden twist. It may suggest that even though something starts off well (as indicated by the first image and the word \"",
    "20240101_175808_3D_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": "The meme presents a play on words using the phrase \"beauty is inside.\" On the left side, it features a beautifully designed paper art piece with the phrase \"Beauty is Inside,\" implying that beauty is an internal characteristic of a person. On the right side, however, it humorously literalizes the phrase by showing a female stick figure standing next to an x-ray screen at an airport security checkpoint, where her insides, including her skeletal structure, are visible. The x-ray image also includes a fancy hairstyle and makeup items inside her silhouette, suggesting that the \"beauty products\" are quite literally inside her. Thus, the punch",
    "20240101_174000_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The meme presents a humorous juxtaposition with the word \"YES,\" followed by a sleek and well-made bed, implying a standard or expectation of neatness and order. Next to it, the word \"BUT\" introduces a contrasting image of the same bed in a disheveled and messy state, showing someone sleeping in a very relaxed and untidy manner. The punchline of the meme is the contrast between the idealized presentation of the bed and the relatable reality of how it's often used in everyday life, highlighting the humorous discrepancy between expectations and actual behavior.",
    "20240101_180319_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": "The meme you've provided shows a play on the duality of a visual representation that can be interpreted in two different ways. On the first panel, it simply presents a vase with flowers under the word \"YES,\" suggesting a positive or agreeable situation. On the second panel, the same image is manipulated to include a cross on what could be perceived as a gravestone, under the word \"BUT,\" indicating a caveat or a less favorable condition. The punchline is in the realization that while the first image seemed purely positive, the second one adds a twist that changes the context to something potentially negative or complicated, despite using the same",
    "20240101_182506_ORIG_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": "The meme consists of two panels with the words \"YES,\" above the first panel and \"BUT\" above the second panel. The first panel shows a pair of legs wearing trousers that are somewhat flared at the bottom, standing on a dry surface. The second panel shows another pair of legs wearing trousers, but these are implausibly twisted and merged with a liquid puddle beneath them, creating a surreal and impossible image. The punchline here is a play on expectations\u2014the first image presents a normal situation followed by the word \"BUT,\" which indicates a contrast, that is humorously and visually represented by the second, bizarre image",
    "20240101_182638_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The meme shows a play on the word \"chicken\" with two contrasting images. The first part says \"YES, CHICKEN\" with a stylized depiction of a happy chicken, implying a positive or wholesome aspect of chicken. The second part says \"BUT\" and shows the same chicken in cartoon form, but this time it's humorously placed within slices of deli meat, which are typically made from chicken, hence the \"BUT\" as a twist showing an ironic or dark humor take on the initial positive image. The punchline lies in the juxtaposition of the chicken's happiness with its fate as food, presented",
    "20240101_173043_3D_YES_3D_BUT.jpg": "The image is a two-panel meme that plays on the visual similarity between the word \"Diet\" and objects that are commonly not associated with a diet. On the left panel, it shows a \"Diet Cola\" can with a standard-sized portion of fries which might be considered a typical diet-friendly alternative due to the diet soda. On the right panel, however, the word \"Diet\" is humorously misconstrued as part of the structure of an exaggeratedly large burger and an enormous portion of fries, suggesting a comically large meal that contradicts typical dietary choices. The punchline is the contrast between the expectation of",
    "20240101_173332_3D_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The punchline of this meme is in the contrast between the left and right images. On the left, we see a phone with a notification for a group chat that includes 28 people, which might generally suggest active participation or social engagement. The right image shows a finger pressing the 'mute' or 'silence' notification bell, implying that while the person acknowledges being part of a group chat, they prefer to mute the notifications, likely due to the number of messages or interruptions they can generate. The \"YES, BUT\" template is commonly used to express a nuanced agreement or a condition that comes with a seemingly positive statement.",
    "20240101_173341_STICK_YES_ORIG_BUT.jpg": "The meme shows a play on the \"Yes, But\" format. On the left side, there's an image that symbolically represents something positive with a big \"YES,\" and on the right side, there's a contrasting image with a \"BUT\" that adds a twist or a complication to the initial positive statement. The punchline is in the juxtaposition of these two images, with the right side image often undermining or humorously altering the context of the left side image. Unfortunately, I cannot describe the specific details of the images, but typically the humor comes from the expectation set by the first image and the surprise or twist presented"
