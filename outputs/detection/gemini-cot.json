These people would seem more deserving of a medal than the man in the \"yes\" section. Thus, my answer is Y.",

In this edited version, all of the happy people are in a pool and labeled \"but\", while a single unhappy person stands on the deck labeled \"yes\". The image is humorous because it is a clever play on the original meme format and because it makes fun of the fact that pools are usually associated with fun and happiness, but in this image the pool is actually a source of sadness for the man. Thus, my answer is Y.",

The image blends a photo of a tsunami crashing into the side of a house with the interior of a living room as the top half. Even though the two images are very different, they fit together seamlessly in this meme format because of the text that is used. The text is the punchline of the meme. The first part, \"Yes,\" sets up the expectation that the second part will be something positive or agreeable. However, the second part, \"But,\" is a complete reversal of this expectation. The tsunami is a natural disaster that is both destructive and deadly and contrasts greatly with the peaceful living room. This unexpected and humorous juxtaposition creates a humorous effect.

In the first image a girl is holding a pumpkin to trick or treat and behind her there are a bunch of bats, and this image is a silhouette. The image is edited in a way that it makes it look funny because the two images relate to each other with the girl in pink's dress looking at the girl in black's dress as if the pink dress girl wants what the black dress girl has.

The image also pokes fun at the way that we use \"yes\" and \"but\" to express different emotions.

A normal person would assume that the higher price is the actual price, and the $14.99 is the \"old price\" which is cheaper. However when you look closely you see that the cheaper price is actually written on the sole of the shoe, as if it were the size.

This is because the clothesline is full of clothes that are all in good condition, while the house is in a state of disrepair. The image is also humorous because it uses the words \"yes\" and \"but\" in a way that is unexpected. The word \"yes\" is typically used to indicate agreement, while the word \"but\" is typically used to indicate disagreement.

The silhouette is wearing a feather in her head, like classic depictions of female fortune tellers. On the right, there is a personification of the digital assistant as a human-like woman, who is telling users that their request for lottery predictions can't be completed because there is an unknown error. This is likely representative of users' frustrations with chatbots and AIs where their requests are not fulfilled.

The woman is looking at her smart phone and the man is talking to a waiter. The waiter has his hand in his pocket, indicating that he is waiting for the man to order.

It thus depicts a scenario in which a man is giving his order to waiter via a woman wearing a hijab. The man has chosen this medium to speak to the waiter because, otherwise, the man would be unable to directly speak to the waiter due to religious and social restrictions. This is obviously absurd and funny. Thus, my answer is Y.",

'YES' shows a bunch of random objects like an easel, stool, compass, bird, and many more objects. 'BUT' also shows a bunch of random objects like an easel, stool, bird, and many more objects. The 'BUT' part is a recreation of the 'YES' part with slight differences and additions. This image is funny because it shows an example of a 'yes' and 'but' scenario that is commonly said in conversation. The 'BUT' part is an example of something being added that is almost exactly the same as what was previously stated, but the result is a contradiction of the first statement.

The caption \"Yes, but\" suggests that the man is experiencing cognitive dissonance since he doesn't mind the volume of the person yelling in the TV but is bothered by the sound of his TV.

This can be interpreted in a number of ways, but one interpretation is that the woman is not happy with her reflection, which is why she is frowning.

This incongruity between the idyllic natural setting and the woman's mundane activity creates a humorous effect. The image is also visually appealing.

    "images/20240101_181411.jpg": " This image is funny because it is a meme. This is evident by the labels on each half of the image \"YES\" and \"BUT\", which are common wording used in the \"yes but\" meme. Furthermore, the image format is similar to other popular memes. The picture portrays a situation where the head of a blue-haired man appears in both halves of the meme, yes and but, indicating that the man does not understand something. In the 'but' image, there is a group of people with different hair colors in the background, which is amusing and unexpected in contrast to the neutrality of the 'yes' image. The picture also highlights that he is not part of the group in the 'but' image, which could be interpreted as his not belonging in the group. This image is humorous because it is relatable and conveys the message that someone's presence might go unnoticed in a large group, making them feel like they don't belong. Thus, my answer is Y.",

The original format typically features two images, with the first image being labeled \"yes\" and the second image being labeled \"but\". The first image is usually something that is positive or desirable, while the second image is something that is negative or undesirable. The humor in the meme comes from the contrast between the two images.\nIn this image, the first image features an organized and clean art studio, while the second image features a messy and disorganized art studio. The contrast between the two images is humorous because it plays on the idea of the messy artist. The artist in the second image is clearly very creative, but they are also very messy. This is a common stereotype of artists, and it is one that is often played for laughs.\nThe humor in this image is also derived from the fact that it is unexpected. The viewer is expecting to see a meme that follows the typical \"yes, but\" format. However, the image subverts this expectation by presenting two images that are both positive. This unexpectedness is what makes the image humorous.\nOverall, this image is a clever and humorous subversion of the popular \"yes, but\" meme format. The image is",

The second panel shows a man watching TV. He is holding his finger to his ear to block out the sound of the woman's TV. The caption on the first panel says \"Yes,\" and the caption on the second panel says \"But.\"\n\nThe meme is funny because it shows that the man is not interested in what the woman is watching, but he does not want to be rude, so he makes an excuse to turn down the sound instead. Another punchline is that man can hear the TV even with his ear plugged which is impossible in real life but a reality in relationships where men are expected to be yes men to their spouse.\n\nThus, my answer is Y.",

The first half shows a model posing for a photoshoot. The second half shows an office environment. The two halves do not complement each other or create a humorous juxtaposition. Therefore, the answer is N.",

In this image, the woman has her fingers crossed as she says, \"Yes\" and on the other hand she has a shadow figure that is picking her nose. This is a funny play on words because usually the phrase \"yes, but\" is followed by a statement or action that contradicts the initial \"yes\" - just like the crossed fingers and picking nose contradicts the \"yes\". Thus, my answer is Y.",
    "yesbut_second_round/20240101_180643_ORIG_YES_STICK_BUT.jpg": " This image is funny because it is a meme and is an edited version of monopoly board. But in place of properties there are different types of money, implying that money in real life can buy all properties shown on monopoly board. Also, since all the money shown is in cash which is not allowed in monopoly, the board shown cannot be used for playing. Thus, my answer is Y.",
    "images/20240101_182338.jpg": " This image is funny because it plays on the words \"yes\" and \"but.\" The first panel shows a person looking at their watch, which says \"10000 steps.\" The second panel shows the same person in a prison cell, with the caption \"But.\" This is funny because it suggests that the person was arrested for walking too much.\n\nThus, my answer is Y.",
    "images/20240101_175031.jpg": " This image is funny because it shows a person using a money gun to shoot money into the air. The money is then shown in the pocket of someone nearby.

The first panel shows a person standing next to a suitcase, which is a common image associated with travel. The second panel shows a brick road, but because the word \"but\" is written underneath, you say \"yes\" and \"but\" next to each other, as if to say yes, but there's a problem, which makes the image funny. Thus, my answer is Y.",

The first image shows a man in a suit walking through an airport, which is a fairly normal and unremarkable image.

This image is also funny because it is referencing how expensive it is to buy an NFT of a picture of a black guy laying on the floor at an airport. Thus, my answer is Y.",
